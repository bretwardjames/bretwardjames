One Saturday I was in the middle of my weekly "responsibilities" at home and, as usual, I was dragging my feet to do a complete job. I had a particular problem doing chores all the way, and I think it annoyed mom quite a bit. I would never quite do the job completely. I would always clean up the big obvious parts of the room that I was supposed to clean, but often the little details would be completely forgotten. In fact, often it was simply that I would vacuum around the couches and things that were against the walls, and mom always wanted me to move everything and vacuum the whole floor. Anyway, on this particular Saturday, I think I was in charge of the family room, which involved lots of moving furniture to really clean. I don't know where mom got this quote, but she came in and told me, "Clean the corners, and let the middle take care of itself."




For a second there, that made no sense to me. Was I supposed to just clean the corners and the rest would magically be cleaned? I had no idea what she meant, but for once in my young years I actually listened to mom and tried it. You know, interestingly enough, it worked like a charm. Instead of just vacuuming the middle of the room and then trying to avoid cleaning the rest, I just started with the corners and edges of the room and went from there. I was surprised at how much easier it was to work that way. Cleaning was never the same for me after that. I always started with the corners and worked my way inward, and it was always easier and quicker. Then after a while, mom started applying that quote to more than just cleaning.




I found it interesting when mom talked about cleaning the corners in a lesson about repentance and change. She didn't really go into much detail or explain very much, but I've thought about that a lot over the years. In general, I've noticed that if I just deal with the main problem in a situation, and leave the outer problems to themselves, the problem actually get's worse. It's kinda like if just cut a weed off at the ground instead of pulling out the roots, it just grows back bigger. If I take care of all of the little issues first before tackling the big problem, however, the whole thing gets resolved. If you just try to take out the head boss of a criminal organization, you still have a bunch of angry criminals running around causing trouble. If you take out the little guys, however, the boss can't really do much and he's an easy target, and will probably just give up.




The biggest reason for this, I found out later, is that 9 times out of ten, having to do a lot of cleanup work after solving a problem can just create more problems, and even re-create the original problem. If you spend too much time having to think about a problem after the problem is resolved, you never let it go, and your mind creates the problem all over again.




The point is sometimes it's better to work your way to a big problem by solving the smaller related problems first. Busting in like John Wayne (Garth Brooks reference) just makes a mess that you have to clean up later.
