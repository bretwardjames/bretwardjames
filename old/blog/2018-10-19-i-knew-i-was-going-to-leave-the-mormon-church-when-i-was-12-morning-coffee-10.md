I am usually the first to disregard my own instincts.   

I love making calculated decisions based on data and analysis.  

In fact, my default setting is pretty much always set to "question everything always".  It's especially true of my own thoughts.  

But I think maybe I lean too far in that direction.  I've made plenty of decisions in my life that it took me several years to finally put into action. I'm always second-guessing myself.  

The potential fallout from taking a hardline stance on something and ending up on the wrong side of it has kept me in limbo way too often (and for way too long).  

I think the reality is that I know the difference between a passing thought that needs to be scrutinized and molded into a mature thought and an instinct that I need to act on.  

Maybe it's better to be wrong sometimes and be true to yourself than it is to be "right" and waste time on the hemming and the hawing.  

I can say that I'm trusting my instincts more these days. And so far I'm not dead.  

So there's that.
