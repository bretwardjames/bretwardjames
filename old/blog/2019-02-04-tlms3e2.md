I think we talk too much about the "honorable pursuit of Truth". \

I don't think truth matters nearly as much as we tell ourselves it does. \

It does, however, give us a nice excuse to ignore our very real emotions by bottling them up until they inevitably explode, destroying most of what makes sense in life. \

Have a listen. \
