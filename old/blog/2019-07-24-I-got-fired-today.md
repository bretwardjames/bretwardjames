Getting fired is strangely one of my favorite things ever.

I know that sounds weird, but it's true. 

Sure, it sucks real bad while it's happening, and it takes quite a while to recover from the pain and self-doubt that you feel from it, but in reality it is the best personal wake-up call you can get.

I've been fired many times, both from jobs and from by clients and I've also been divorced so I can see, I know firsthand the similarities between the two. They are very, very similar. First of all, when you get fired from a job or if you have a client that lets you go and just want to work with anymore, whatever it is, chances are it wasn't a great situation to begin with. There probably were some indications that that was coming. The fact that you got fired is the best wake up call that you could possibly have for yourself. 

That's what's happening. Panda apparently wants you to be involved in. That's fine. That's fine. 

Everybody looks at like, so quote unquote negative situations and negative experiences and as, as being detrimental or bad negative experiences are just learning experiences. You don't really ever lose. You just learn there's more good that comes out of this than there ever was bad. In fact, it's only good. You just gotta to understand: the clients that you have wouldn't have hired you if they didn't need you. So even if they leave, it's not like they know better. This guy was trying to make it out. Like he somehow knew better. He was better at what I was going to do, what he thinks he's asking for. He can't get anywhere. He tried to, he tried to even make a comment like, well, if you're a jack of all trades, then you're not really that good at anything. 

And I wanted to be like, but I left. I was just like, okay, whatever. Like I don't, doesn't make a difference to me if you don't think this is the right thing, you don't have to spend money on the right thing. You can spend money on the wrong thing and that's fine. I think he wanted me to acknowledge that I wasn't very good and I wasn't going to do that. And I think that's the big thing. This is not the first time that I've been fired by a client, not the first time that I fired a client for the same thing. I fired clients for the same types of situations, not the first or the last time that that's going to happen. And the truth is it happens all the time. And clients just don't know what they want. They don't know how to get it and they don't know what they're looking for. 

And sometimes, if they are not very easy communicate with, or if you don't have a very good job of communicating, and I've been guilty of that, you're going to end up in a situation where you cannot, they just don't get it. And they're going to, they're gonna fuss and they're gonna put up a big stink about it and probably end up, you get fired. I could have kept him on the line today. I could've been like, okay, well, how about this? I'll just give you five hours for free and we'll do something, we'll try something else and see if it works better for you and then move forward that way. And he probably would have been like, oh, okay. Yeah, and that's probably what he was fishing for was for me to give him some free time, but I'm not going to do that now. 

That's not to say that it wasn't, it didn't suck. I'm pretty zen down, but I'm not like unemotional and I wasn't super happy when he was saying it to me and so I, my mouth got all dry and I was all upset. Then afterwards it was like, oh yeah, that's fine. Anyway, so the point of all this is besides me giving myself an excuse to talk to you guys while I bring these, I'm sure that he doesn't appreciate being put on film for that. Getting clients and losing clients, not the point. Clients come, clients go, jobs come, jobs go, relationships come, relationships go. You can't get so tied into the fact that you have one that you can't see that it's actually a good thing sometimes when they end, because it gives you a chance to grow and move on to the next thing
