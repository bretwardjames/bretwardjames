Public Service Announcement Regarding Sugar 

We take a slight break from our usual Morning Coffee show for a PSA about sugar :)

In the span of my life, science has changed its mind about sugar about 12 times.

Then, more recently, it became common knowledge that some of the early “science” was influenced heavily by parts of the food industry that were heavy on added sugar in their foods.

I haven’t done my homework on reading the studies or the research, but here’s what I know:

I’ve paid a LOT more attention to my health, diet, physique, and energy over the last 5 years or so. I’ve kind of had to.

In that time, I’ve noticed a couple of things about sugar that have been true (for me) every time.

Sugar in any form is HELPFUL for fueling and recovering from an intense workout (emphasis on intense)

When not paired with intense exercise, sugar consumption causes me to sleep more hours (but feel less rested)

Every time I’ve made an effort to restrict my sugar consumption, I’ve lost on average 10 pounds within 3 weeks.

Everything else tastes better when I’m restricting my sugar consumption.

The big caveat here is this:

Restricting sugar consumption is HARD. Everything has added sugar. Like, EVERYTHING.

I’m not even going to take this any further. At this point I feel like you can come to your own conclusions about that.

PSA over :)
