The friction that exists between sales and fulfillment is, although annoying for both parties, integral to growth. That's especially true for a fledgling tech company like Infusionsoft in the early days.

After Dave and Cody joined the team, I remember there being a good deal of animosity between us (the support/training/fulfillment team) and sales.

They were so focused on making the sale that they would promise things that we (the support team) weren't fully prepared to deliver.

At the time, I was more than a little pissed off about it. And if memory serves, I was fairly vocal about it as well.

But luckily for everyone involved, my complaints were largely ignored.

It would have been really convenient for ME if they hadn't asked me to step outside my comfort zone and do new things. 

But looking back - the only way that we could possibly have grown as much and as fast as we did is by doing more to get the sale.

And in retrospect, it wasn't just about the revenue from the sale (although let's be honest, that doesn't hurt). It was about developing the company by inserting ourselves into more actual businesses so we could discover what we needed to do as a company.

We needed to be implementing the software for real businesses so we could really test what worked and what didn't. 

And because Clate's vision wasn't just to serve a few companies in big cities in the US, but to serve ALL small businesses EVERYWHERE (I might be overquoting here but it helps make my point), we needed to make sure that what we were selling them was actually going to help them.

I wasn't thinking big enough. I wanted things to not be hard. I wanted things to fit into a box.

I wasn't willing to eat crow (to quote Gary Vaynerchuk) for the sake of a bigger vision, because I didn't see it.

That's a lesson that's taken me almost 15 years to really learn. It wasn't until I fully committed to building my own consultancy and brand that it finally clicked for me:

You. Gotta. Think. Bigger.

There's nothing wrong with thinking small and being ok with it. But when what you REALLY want is to legitimately have a voice on a global scale (like I do), you HAVE to think bigger. 

You can't become a billion dollar company if you're not willing to do the work required to get there.

You don't become Nike if you're not willing to make shoes that suck.

You don't become Kevin Hart if you're not willing to get booed off stage.

You don't become Floyd Mayweather if you're not willing to lose.

But once you commit to the larger vision, to the bigger picture, those things become insignificant. 

When you realize that what you are trying to do is so much bigger than each individual at-bat, everything becomes a stepping stone to the eventual goal.

But you won't acheive that goal without going back to the plate to swing at whatever life throws.

Think bigger.

Acheive more.
