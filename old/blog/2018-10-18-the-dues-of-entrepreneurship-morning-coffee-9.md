I never liked the idea of "paying my dues". I always thought that was beneath me for some reason.  

I just wanted people to notice what I was doing and give me the credit that I thought I deserved.  

Ironically enough, although I was (and still am) KILLING it in the work I was doing, I hadn't done ANYTHING to deserve the notoriety or credit I was after.  

Sure, I have always gotten a lot of referrals for business because I do good work, but what I really WANTED was for someone to ask me to speak from stage, or come out and present to 50 staff members, or co-present on a webinar to a couple thousand people.  

I wasn't willing (until recently) to acknowledge that the way you get to stage and to cohost and guest blog and all that is by creating a brand, not just by doing good work.  

It's not that good work isn't important. It's fundamentally important, and it's the backbone of the whole thing, but it's not going to get you the recognition you're looking for all on its own.  

It's like a car engine. You can have the most powerful car engine, but without gas, it's not going anywhere.   

By the same token, all the gas in the world isn't going to get you very far if your engine is no good.  

So, just like I'd spent a decade patiently and arduously developing my skills on the technology and consulting side, I had to decide to make a decision to make that same journey for my brand.  

I have to pay my dues just like everyone else in order to get what I want.  

It takes a bit of humility to realize that you have to start back at square one, but I get super excited about it.  

The Dues of Entrepreneurship are time, energy, and effort.   

You can't get around paying them.
