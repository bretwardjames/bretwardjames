I want to take a break from my grandstanding and say something that I should have said a long time ago. Really, I should have realized that this needed to be said a long time ago, but I'm stubborn and proud. I'm working on that.




My therapist says I'm an angry person. I think he's right. Everything that I do and everything that happens to me is tinted by an underlying layer of anger that I've never fully understood (or tried to understand, for that matter). Tonight, I think I may have made a breakthrough discovery, and please don't take this as a pity party. There's a point here.




I've spent the last couple of years dealing with a deep feeling of isolation. I feel isolated from people, disconnected from relationships. I haven't really felt important to anyone in a very long time. I find myself angrily "advertising" my blog posts on Facebook, absolutely pissed that people don't care enough about me to read on their own. I sometimes just sit and fume that I don't have people in my life that want to know how I feel, and how I'm really doing, at least not people who are proactive about letting me know that they care. I don't want this to turn into a sob story, but the point is that I've just felt like a means to an end, instead of an end unto itself. I feel like everyone should be treated like ends unto themselves.




Tonight, I made a startling discovery. That phrase, what goes around comes around, is absolutely true.




I started thinking tonight about why I feel the way I do. What is it about me that people want to stay away from, or that keeps people at armâ€™s length from me? Why am I fighting so hard with people to get them to notice me and appreciate me? Then it hit me.




I was an absolute jerk in high school, and even on my mission. Even after coming back from my mission I haven't really improved that much, although I do like to think that I've improved some. But back then, nothing mattered but what I thought. I was the ultimate example of good and correct, and everyone else just didn't measure up. I'm surprised that people would still talk to me after putting up with that for so long. Here's the kicker. I treated everyone as an means to and end, except for one person. I won't go into who or why; the point is I was a jerk to almost everyone. And here I am feeling sorry for myself because I'm so isolated from everyone. What do I expect after treating people so terribly?




I hope that everyone I've ever known reads this next part, because I feel like I've taken advantage of just about everyone that I know.




I'm so sorry.




I'm sorry for everything. The holier-than-thou attitude that I had, the pride in my own infallibility, the using people for my own purposes, I'm sorry for all of it. I'm sorry for making you feel like dirt with things that I said. I'm sorry for disregarding your feelings on my "quest for spiritual perfection". I'm sorry for "never being wrong". I could go on forever. I'm sorry to each and every one of you for everything that I've done to you. I've been a terrible friend to most of you, and worse to some of you.




I love you all for the fact that you didn't just leave me alone in high school, or ever for that matter. I am so grateful that you have enough patience with me to give me so many second chances. I can't tell you how terrible I feel each time I remember another instance when I took advantage of you or betrayed you. I'm doing my penance now.




I just want you all to know that I'm sorry for whatever I may have done to you in the past, and that I'm now reaping the rewards of my actions. I honestly regret the way that I acted back then, and I'm working hard to not continue in that way.




And I'll always be sorry.
