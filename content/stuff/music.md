I started my music training at the ripe old age of 8 on the piano. I really hated piano when I was younger, I think
because I've always really hated the idea of "chores", and I saw practicing as a chore. \

And then I got a little bit of attention at school for being able to play, and my mind _completely_ changed about it. \

I did choirs and plays throughout junior high and high school. Fast forward to college, and I performed with a couple 
groups: \

|  Recently Left Handed |   | Russian Choir  |
|---|---|---|
|One was a sort of acoustic duo that performed a few times at local shops. We did a little bit of original stuff, but mostly it was covers: ||I was also given the opportunity to direct the Russian Choir at BYU, which was awesome. Here are some videos of our performance: |
