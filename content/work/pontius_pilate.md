When I rose up that fine spring day, and gazed out at the dawn, \
The sun began, a single ray, twas me it fell upon.\
My servants came, began to say, "The Hebrews, they all plea, \
They want you to take this man and nail him to a tree." \

They told me all about him, this man from Nazareth. \
"He healed their sick, he gave them life, and now they want his death. \
"He has no fault, no single stain; the law should set him free. \
"But now I fear, the Jews won't rest 'till you nail him to a tree." \

And so it was, that fateful day, I went into the throng \
To meet the man they wanted dead, yet who had done no wrong. \
The Hebrews all around me, they want the killer free. \
"Take this man instead," they said, "and nail _Him_ to a tree." \

The man they threw before me, I noticed as I saw, \
Did not respond to jeers and shouts; His wrists were bound and raw. \
I asked him then, what he had done, and of his royalty. \
Then when he spoke he pierced me; I can't nail Him to a tree. \

His face was calm, his eyes aglow, He stood condemned to die. \
"I was born to be a King," He said, "My kingdom is on high." \
"Art Thou a king?" I asked Him then,. Confused, I did not see. \
I sent him off to Herod, _his_ decision it would be. \

And when they brought him back to me, 'twas in the selfsame day, \
They told me what had happened, and then what he did say. \
When Herod asked, "Art thou the Christ?", He responded royally. \
The priests said, "He speaks blasphemies, this man from Galilee." \

So Herod sent him back to me, robed in royal blue. \
My soul was racked, my mind was torn, I knew not what to do. \
This man, I knew, had done no wrong since he left Galilee. \
What should I do, let him go? Or nail him to a tree? \

The Jews, I knew, when tempers flared won't rest until appeased. \
And in keeping down insurgence, my lord would be quite pleased. \
My instinct and my Roman youth seemed to be telling me, \
"Give the Jews Barabbas, and nail _him_ to a tree." \

And so it was, that fateful day, I went into the throng. \
I gave them whom they wanted dead, yet who had done no wrong. \
The Hebrews all around me still want the killer free. \
I took this man, this _Jesus_, and I nailed Him to a tree.
