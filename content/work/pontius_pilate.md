When I rose up that fine spring day,\
And gazed out at the dawn, \
The sun began, a single ray,\
Twas me it fell upon.\

My servants came, began to say, \
"The Hebrews, they all plea, \
They want you to take this man \
And nail him to a tree." \

They told me all about him, \
This man from Nazareth. \
"He healed their sick, he gave them life \
And now they want his death. \

He has no fault, no single stain; \
The law should set him free. \
But now I fear, the Jews won't rest \
'Till you nail him to a tree." \

And so it was, that fateful day, \
I went into the throng \
To meet the man they wanted dead, \
Yet who had done no wrong. \

The Hebrews all around me, \
They want the killer free. \
"Take this man instead," they said, \
And nail Him to a tree. \

The man they threw before me, \
I noticed as I saw, \
Did not respond to jeers and shouts; \
His wrists were bound and raw. \

I asked him then, what he had done, \
And of his royalty. \
Then when he spoke he pierced me; \
I Can't nail Him to a tree. \

His face was calm, his eyes aglow, \
He stood condemned to die. \
"I was born to be a King," He said, \
"My kingdom is on high." \

"Art Thou a king?" I asked Him then, \
Confused I did not see, \
I sent him off to Herod, \
His decision it would be. \

And when they brought him back to me, \
'Twas in the selfsame day, \
They told me what had happened, \
And then what he did say. \

When Herod asked, "Art thou the Christ?" \
He responded royally. \
The priests said, "He speaks blasphemies, \
This man from Galilee." \

So Herod sent him back to me, \
Robed in royal blue. \
My soul was racked, my mind was torn, \
I knew not what to do. \

This man, I knew, had done no wrong \
Since he left Galilee. \
What should I do, let him go? \
Or nail him to a tree? \

The Jews, I knew, when tempers flared \
Won't rest until appeased. \
And in keeping down insurgence, \
My lord would be quite pleased. \

My instinct and my Roman youth \
Seemed to be telling me, \
"Give the Jews Barabbas \
And nail him to a tree." \

And so it was, that fateful day, \
I went into the throng. \
I gave them whom they wanted dead, \
Yet who had done no wrong. \

The Hebrews all around me \
Still want the killer free. \
I took this man, this Jesus, and \
I nailed Him to a tree.
