# "Sleep"

by Me

The day is ending, the battle's won. \
So now, to sleep, to rest. \
I've won the day, the battle's done. \
Alive, with no strength left. 



The sweet reprieve, reviving calm, \
Returns to me my brawn. \
But lining that all-healing balm: \
The night ends with the dawn. 



The dark of dream brings peaceful zen, \
But also nervous angst. \
For tomorrow's just today again, \
And again and again and again.
