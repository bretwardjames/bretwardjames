I’m not on very good terms with Facebook right now. I believe that it has single-handedly (or cyber-handedly, if you prefer) taken all conversational etiquette right out of our society. There is not one shred of the politeness that I have now come to really appreciate when I do actually encounter it.




Back story:




I posted the following as my status on Facebook about a month ago:




Watched "Everything is Illuminated" tonight. Amazing flick. You probably would have to understand Russian and English, and have lived in Ukraine to really get it, though, which is kinda sad, but at the same time, awesome. Incredible show.




Notice how I didn’t ask for comments. I was very obviously just making a comment about what I thought was a good movie. Almost immediately I started getting responses. The first couple were in affirmation of what I said, although one made a comment about being able to understand the movie even without speaking Russian or living in Ukraine (which is totally bogus, btw). Then an incredibly horrid thing started happening. I started receiving comments about how people disagreed with what I was saying. Where I come from, unless someone is asking for a critique or a response, if you don’t agree with what they’re saying, YOU DON’T SAY ANYTHING!! You just politely decline to comment, because it doesn’t really matter if you agree or disagree. It’s not a debate.




I blame Facebook. I think all this cyber-communication has made it too easy to be abrasively blunt and call it “honesty”. I still believe in politeness. It’s ok for someone else to think differently than you, and it’s also ok for you NOT to make comments in direct contradiction of what someone else thinks just because you disagree. Sometimes people are asking for comment (i.e. this blog has a standing invitation for comment) whether implicitly or explicitly, but unless you absolutely know that, just chill your bones and let it slide.




That being said, I want to invite any reader to comment on what they think the difference between being honest and being abrasive is, and which you do/prefer.
