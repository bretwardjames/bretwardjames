# Reason #1: Humanity

The thing about Muay Thai, and all combat sports really, is that it's so purely human. There's nothing but glove and sweat between you and your opponent. There are no tricks, no weapons, it's skin against skin alone.

It's just you and what you are physically capable of doing with your body and your opponent and what he (or she) is capable of doing with his (hers). And there is something so satisfyingly simple about that.

In my experience, most of life is convincing other people that you're capable of doing what you say you're capable of doing. In combat sports, you are either better than your opponent (and you win) or you aren't (and you lose). It's that simple.

There are no excuses to be made, no reasons to be given, no blame to be placed. You show up, do the best you know how, and the result is immediately apparent.

I've never felt more human in my life than when I'm sparring or fighting, which is another reason why I do both as often as I can.

There's an interesting correlation that I've noticed between sparring (play fighting used to prepare for real fights) and navigating personal relationships. Funnily enough, I've been in relationships (romantic, platonic, familial, bromantic, etc) my whole life, but I would _never_ have picked up on the interpersonal hacks that literally punching someone in the face has taught me so plainly and clearly.

First, an explanation of sparring:

Sparring is simulated fighting. Normally we wear bigger gloves and shin guards, and we tend to go a little easier than we would in a real fight, but the point of sparring is to practice the realtime application of what we've learned from the drills and concepts we've been working on.

Whether or not you're going to actually participate in a fight, sparring is a great way to improve your skills quickly, not to mention it's probably the most fun you can have with your clothes on.

The really cool part is how counterintuitive the result of sparring is. You'd think that the act of punching and kicking another person (for fun) would have a negative impact on the personal relationship between the two people, but it's actually the exact opposite. My best friends in the world also happen to be the ones that I hit in the face (and hit me back) on the most regular basis.

Even further than that, these friends of mine understand that pulling punches does neither of us any good. So, because we both want to improve in the sport, and because we both want to really test ourselves, we hit each other pretty hard. Without malice, of course, but always with a spirit of healthy competition that drives each of us to overcome the adversity we're presented with and perform at our best.


 
   

 


In personal life, I've found the same to be true. Friendships, relationships, family situations: nobody grows if we're not giving 100% all the time. Holding back real feelings only makes for stale, unproductive relationships, and nobody wants that.

It can be kind of difficult to breach that barrier, though. Most of us have a line that we don't cross with certain people, because we tell ourselves that we're being respectful of their beliefs, feelings, opinions, etc. And most of us have operated under a need to maintain that line our whole lives (and our parent's did the same, and their parents, etc).

But just like in sparring, if I refuse to bring up a sensitive subject with a friend or family member because I'm afraid of offending them, how will they ever be able to cope with a different person bringing up the same thing with no concern for offending them?

Of course I don't mean you should blast everyone all the time for all of the thoughts, opinions, or beliefs that you don't personally agree with. Even in sparring, there are levels. Say someone is new to the sport, or new to the gym. What if someone is injured? You don't take the person that just got reconstructive surgery on their knee and just blast their knee into oblivion. You work with them on the level that they are comfortable and ready to work.

Sometimes a round of sparring can escalate quite quickly. If I catch you with something, and you immediately come back with something and get me, we can build off that energy and go from light "feeling out" sparring to a full-contact war really quickly. This happens quite regularly. The funny thing is it usually starts out with the two partners saying to each other, "Let's just flow", or "Let's go light." But that competitive spirit in both of them comes out almost immediately and then it's back to war as per the usual.


 
   

 


The point here is that a little competition between humans is not only healthy, it's _necessary._ I spent a lot of my younger years trying to avoid competition because competition involves confrontation (which I hate), but more and more I'm finding that when I speak my mind, or when I voice unpopular opinions, or when I gently question someone else's opinion for the sake of honest dialogue, everyone grows and everyone wins.

And on the flipside, every time I "keep my mouth shut" or "leave it alone", I notice almost immediately the opportunity for mutual growth and respect that's been lost.

### So that's the first big reason why I train and fight:

## I'm a better person because of it.
