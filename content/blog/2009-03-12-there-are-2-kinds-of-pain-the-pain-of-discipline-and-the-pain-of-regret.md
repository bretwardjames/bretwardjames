I think this was mom's favorite quote, and she adopted it sometime during my sophomore or junior year of high school. This one has had more application in my life than any other phrase or idea I think. In fact, I have spread this around, and now it's pretty well known in some areas.




It basically explains itself, but I'll try to do it justice:




For every situation, there are usually a few different options as far as what you can do in that situation. We are choosing to do things every day, and everything we do stems from one or more of those decisions. We cannot, however, choose the consequences of our actions, meaning we can't choose to get a raise if we choose to slack off at work. We can, however, make decisions based on the consequences, and also based on what I like to call pre-emotion and post-emotion.




Pre-emotion is not a difficult concept, it's simply the emotion that we feel at the beginning or before we make a decision. This includes all of our thought processes, ideas, opinions and has a lot to do with our current life status and the way we were raised. Post-emotion is the feeling we get at the end or after we've made our choice and felt the consequences. It's important to understand that post-emotion is not the immediate result of the choice, but the feeling after the decision has fully been made and all consequences of that choice have been enjoyed or suffered. This is where discipline and regret come in.




When analyzing a situation or decision, it is important to take into consideration both your pre-emotion and your post-emotion. Your pre-emotion can very drastically affect your choice, because people base most of their choices on what they have previously experienced, which is usually good. For example, a person who was given an extreme amount of sympathy as a child would lean toward giving sympathy to a friend, whereas someone who was given little sympathy in childhood would most likely look for other ways to help a friend, such as leaving them alone, trying to get them away from the bad situation, or simply giving them 'tough love'. Another example is a person who has never really learned or experienced the consequences of procrastination. If presented with a situation where there is a choice between procrastinating and not procrastinating, that person will feel no urge to be proactive, and therefore will most likely put off the duty until the very last minute. Then once you have a good understanding of your pre-emotion, you need to consider the post-emotion.




Our pre-emotion is simply what we are inclined to do based on our past. When considering post-emotion is when the consideration of the 2 Pains comes in. On the one hand, we have the choice to satisfy our immediate needs or desires, succumbing to the desire for immediate gratification. This choice almost invariably leads to the eventual Pain of Regret. Very seldom is a choice that results in immediate pleasure not followed by a situation that would present even more satisfaction and pleasure, but because of that initial choice, you are disqualified from even taking part in the second situation. This is when the Pain of Regret stings with all its fury. "Oh if only I had not been so selfish in the beginning, I could experience this greater joy now," is the lament of those inflicted with this Pain. Those who chose immediate discipline, however, sing an altogether different song.




If in the consideration of post-emotion we consider that denying ourselves of a certain pleasure now will result in greater satisfaction later, we are choosing the Pain of Discipline. This Pain can be sharp and in some instances almost unbearable, but without exception the result is long-lasting satisfaction that is far superior to the immediate pleasure experienced by those who chose the Pain of Regret. Take for example the person who trains for years for a marathon race, building up endurance and discipline. When they run the race, while it is painful in its own right, they can not only actually finish the race, but do well, and the satisfaction of the win far outweighs the pain of the race. A person who has not trained for a marathon may in fact by some stroke of luck or superhuman strength do well in the race, but the pain he/she will feel as a result of running a marathon without putting in the necessary preparation will far outweigh any pleasure they receive from placing well in the race.




Take whatever personal application you will from this; the principle applies almost universally. You will have to experience one of these 2 Pains as a result of every choice you make. The difference is that following the Pain of Discipline there is always great satisfaction, whereas following the Pain of Regret there is nothing but a continuation of that Pain. 




Choose wisely.
