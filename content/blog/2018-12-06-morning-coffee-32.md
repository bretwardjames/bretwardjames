Do you have a college degree? What about an industry certification? 

Did you notice that it’s possible to get either of those without really knowing anything about the subject matter? 

Or, conversely, remember that scene from Good Will Hunting, where he tells the Harvard student that he wasted $150,000 on an education he could have gotten for $1.50 in late fees at the public library?

In truth, college educations and industry certifications are unfortunately _not_ synonymous with competence or expertise. There are enough examples of people who achieved the accolades but don’t have the first clue about the subject matter,.

And there are _plenty_ of people that have real-world expertise in those matters that never bothered pursuing either.

That doesn’t mean there’s something wrong with getting a degree or certification - in fact sometimes those things are necessary to advance your goals.

But it’s important that you not consider them as anything more than what they actually are:

Pieces of paper.
