After my long quasi-rant that I went on in my [previous post](http://bretwardjames.com/logic-vs-intuition-the-fatal-confusion/), I began to think about logic (naturally) and that led me to think of the professor who has taught and is still teaching me logic. He's easily one of my favorite teachers ever, and yesterday he mentioned that when he is particularly frustrated or upset at something (or more often, someone) he writes limericks. He said that this really helps him to get out his frustration in a somewhat diffusing manner. Inspired by this, I condensed my previous post about logic and intuition into a limerick. I hope you enjoy reading it as much as I enjoyed writing it:




On Logic: a limerick
March 19, 2011




When to reason assay's my endeavor,
My first try's to intuit. However,
'Tis not intuition
That makes a logician;
Logic oft makes no sense whatsoever.
