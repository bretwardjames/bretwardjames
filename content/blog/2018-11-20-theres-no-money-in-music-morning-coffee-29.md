I came out of high school really wanting to go into music education. I wanted to be a choir teacher at some junior college somewhere, and eventually get the opportunity to conduct a university choir.

And I was GOOD, by the way. Still am, although I'm out of practice.

But somewhere along the line, I let someone convince me that there was no money in music.

And from that moment on, it became "clear" to me that the right choice was to pursue law, and leave music behind altogether.

At the time, I figured I knew enough about how life worked that the decision to abandon the music and do law was the "right" choice.

If only I knew then what I know now.

It's not that I regret where I've ended up. I am really happy with my life. My experiences have shaped me into who I've become. 

But I can't help but wonder whether I'd have become a better version of myself if I'd stuck with what I wanted to do.

The truth is, there was no possible way for me to know how my choice back then was going to work out for me. 

But I was CONVINCED, not only that I was making the right decision, but that it was the ONLY right decision.

And since then, I've been in so many situations where I've been absolutely convinced that something is true, only to find out later that I was completely mistaken.

We can't really know anything for certain - the math is too big.

There are way too many variables to consider for us to actually think we can predict any outcome.

And yet we do it all the time. We make decisions based on these "informed" hypotheses that are really just uneducated guesses. 

No matter how convinced you are of something, life will show you an angle you weren't expecting.

Best thing to do is exactly what you want - because whether you choose the "wise" or the "foolish" route, the net result is the same:

You get some things right. You get most things wrong. Life beats you down, and then you have a few amazing moments.
