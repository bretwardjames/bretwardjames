A company that I used to work for, Keap (formerly known as Infusionsoft) laid off a bunch of people yesterday. They've
been laying people off for a while now, so much so that support groups have popped up to help ease the transition. \

A lot of people are saying how sorry they are, in an attempt to empathize. After all, most of these other people were also
let go at one point or another. And I totally get the sentiment and the desire to be welcoming and warm to those people
during this albeit scary transition, but I am staunchly and firmly _not_ sorry. \

To all of the people who got laid off yesterday, I'll tell you what Frank Kern told me when I told him I was getting 
divorced: \

He said, "A lot of people are going to tell me how sorry they are, but ***f\*\*\* that!*** Your life is only going to 
get better from here. I'm extremely happy for you!"

And to all the recently unemployed Infusionites/Keapers, same same.

I'm not sorry, because it's better for you. I'm happy for you. Not because Infusionsoft is a terrible place to work or 
anything like that (quite the contrary), but rather because the opportunity for personal growth is *always* a positive
challenge which, if met head on, makes you a better, more valuable person.

Think about it - nobody is _ever_ sad when someone graduates from college, right? It's a _happy_ time. That's all that's
happening here. You've graduated from a _great_ college, and now it's time to spread those wings, baby!

So to everyone that just lost their job, congrats! And here's to the next chapter(s) being *better* than the one before.
