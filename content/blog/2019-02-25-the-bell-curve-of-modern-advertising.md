I can't stand most advertising today. 

Let me rephrase that.

Most advertising today is terrible. 

Like terrible terrible.

Like _inexcusably_ terrible.

Like, "Sir Charles, can you come over here and tell them how turruble this is" terrible.

I see three big reasons why it's so terrible:

1. Big Brands Don't Know What "Tactical" Is

Aside from the recent Pepsi ads, I can't tell you the last time I saw a big-budget ad run in my Facebook or Instagram feed. Like a real, big-budget, super-high-production-value, $5 million budget ad.

That's not to say they aren't being made, they absolutely are. It _is_ to say, however, that I'm not seeing them, which means I'm not being targeted for some reason.

It's not like I don't respond to ads on social platforms _all the time_. It's not like I am "not in their target demo".

So why do I never see their ads? 

They are still stuck in the old-world, wide-sweeping, _strategic_ world of advertising. To them, it's about hitting as many people in one go as possible. It's still about trying to get people to talk about the ad after they've seen it.

But that never happens any more. Why? By the time any of us are with someone that we could talk about the ad with, we've seen 10-15 other ads that are more relevant and easier to act on.
