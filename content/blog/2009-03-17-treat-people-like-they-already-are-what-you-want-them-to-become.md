Dad is my hero for so many reasons, but I think the biggest reason is because in so many ways I want to be able to be half the father he was to me to my children. He always has had such a way with people, and not only have I never heard anyone say a single bad thing about him, I have never once heard him say anything negative about anyone. No exceptions. I'll talk more about being positive later, but I just wanted to preface these next two lessons with that fact.




Dad taught me this lesson partially just by example and in a small way it was a lesson that he sat me down to teach. He taught me better than anyone else to give people the benefit of the doubt, and seeing how much people love him has made me really latch on to this. I think he applied this principle to his relationship with me more than I saw it anywhere else. When I was young, dad must have noticed how I loved to sit and listen when he and my older brothers and brothers-in-law would talk about grown up stuff, because by the time I made it to high school, dad was including me in these conversations, and he even had many such conversations with me one on one. Dad made me feel so important and smart, and really let me contribute to the conversations. And yet, I always came away having learned so much. This developed into a very deep relationship between dad and me, and some of my best memories of me and dad together are our deep conversations after church on Sundays.




I've come to realize over time that when I treat people like they are already doing what I want them to or what they need to, without exception they always rise to the occasion. Training mission companions was a perfect example of this. If I treated a companion like they were so green that they couldn't do anything, I would find myself doing all the talking, teaching, planning, studying, and deciding, and I actually stunted the learning of my companions. But when I finally got a brand new missionary, I treated him like a regular junior companion that had been in the country almost as long as I had. He learned so much faster when I treated him like an equally capable missionary to myself. Since then, I have noticed this same principle in so many different places.




The principle behind this lesson is that people deserve to feel good about themselves, and sometimes the only thing that keeps a person from really pushing for their potential is a person who gives them the idea that they aren't capable. A child who is treated like a child will remain a child. An adult who is treated like a child will act like a child. A dancer who is treated like a failure will almost without exception fail. Any person who is treated like they are worthless will eventually believe it. If you want a child to act more like an adult, treat them like an adult! You can't expect a child to learn responsibility if you are always telling them what to do and how to do it. That, however, doesn't mean give them total free reign to do whatever they want and walk all over you. The world will not let them walk all over anyone that they want, so don't you let them.




By the same token, if you have an employee that you want to up their work standard so you can advance them, treat them like they deserve to be advanced. Not only will your workers respect you more, they will actually live up to the compliments that you give them. Allowing those that are under you to rise to greater responsibility is the best and only way to have a functioning and thriving work environment.




Workers, like children and people in general, are either improving or digressing at any given point, and a sure fire way to ensure improvement is to encourage and reward it. If you have an employee who is slacking in his job, chances are he isn't just doing it to spite you. He may have some personal issue that is hidden from you that is distracting him from his tasks. He may be dissatisfied with his job, and therefore has no motivation to do well. Usually workers digress in performance because they don't want to be there.




The plain fact is people love to be praised, and praise is something that people will work for. The paradox of praise, however, is that workers need praise to do well, and employers need results to give praise. So many people will argue either way about which side should start the process, but I believe whole-heartedly that it is the responsibility of the employer to provide a healthy work environment for his employees, meaning: Those in positions of leadership (parents, older siblings, employers, professors, religious leaders) are responsible to provide the motivation for those over whom they preside to do well. It is the leaders, not the followers, who have to lead, not just direct. If leaders will treat their employees like they are the best employees they have ever had, or if a parent will treat their children like they are the greatest children a parent could ask for, (and on into infinity with other examples) almost invariably those employees will actually be the best employees that the employer has ever had. Almost invariably, children who are told that they are the best children a parent could ask for will excel, because children who know they are noticed love to make their parents proud.




My conclusion to this is actually my thesis, and I would have made this statement at the beginning except I wanted to lay down some foundation before I said it. Taking into consideration what has been said about parents and children, and employers and employees, it's important to understand that we need to treat people like they are what we want them to be, or to put it better, we need to treat people as thought they are already what they want to be. Here is my conclusion; I hope you can get my point:




It is the audience's responsibility to give the performers the applause necessary to perform well.
