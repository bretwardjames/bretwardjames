They say "Cash is King". I think what *they* mean by that is that cash (money) is something that everyone can use more of,
and therefore it's something that you can use in almost any case as a means of motivating or leveraging someone to do 
what you want.

Some businesses will offer `Cash Back` or a `Gift Card With Purchase` as a way to take advantage of that idea, trying to 
motivate their prospect to purchase by offering cash in return for a purchase.

As a side note, I'm surprised how often that works (on me). Net net it's a loss for me. Every time. 

Every. Single. Time.

But for some reason my brain has a way of rationalizing that it's a good decision.

Anyhoo, I digress.

Turns out the whole thing is completely false! Cash is *not* actually king. Cash is just the lowest common denominator 
*medium*.

It's actually `Incentive`.

This is not a groundbreaking idea in the least. I think everyone reading (all 4 of you), will agree that the only reason
cash has any power is that since it's a virtually universal need, there's a virtually universal incentive to acquire more
of it. 

In fact, some of you might be slightly annoyed that I'm splitting hairs. Again. Bear with me.

*Understanding* that incentive is the root of motivation is one thing, but *practicing* that understanding is often 
entirely something else.

It is very rare that we mortals are *actually* altruistically motivated enough to take on the incentives of others. Meaning
we are, rightly so, `looking out for #1` the vast majority of the time.

But what we fail to notice is how often the realization of our incentive lies *beyond* the incentives of others.

For example:

You call up customer service for Walmart.com because your order of deep fried twinky wings won't go through, even though 
you *know* there's enough money on the card.

You are obviously upset - twinky wings are just the greatest thing ever and you may not get them, and as far as you can 
tell, it's the website's fault. There's nothing wrong with expecting a service provider to, you know, provide the service
they're supposed to provide.

When the customer service agent answers the phone, it is immediately apparent that this call is being fielded by an 
outsourced call center in a foreign country, which doesn't exactly boost your confidence in a positive resolution to this
call. You start to feel a bit desperate - you just want your twinky wings, damn it!

Enter the call rep...

I'm going to stop here, because most of us don't. At this time, it is very easy (and *extremely* common) to vent all of
your pent up frustration and the anxiety of not getting those precious twinky wings on this poor guy. After all, it's 
*his* site, *he* works for them, and it's *his* job to make it right. There is no `incentive` for you to treat him as 
anything but a combative witness, your honor!

Be that as it may, let's just take a step back and consider something.

This guy on the other end of the line *also* operates on incentive. Imagine you picked up the phone and for 5 minutes 
straight it was like one of those cartoons where the phone is so loud the person has to hold the receiver with two hands 
and the noise is blowing their hair back. You know the ones.

Enter the million dollar question:

#### What would you be *incentivized* to do at that point?

Something like this, maybe?

Now imagine your *job* is to pick up the phone to people like that, all day, every day, for almost no money. Can you 
imagine a universe where
