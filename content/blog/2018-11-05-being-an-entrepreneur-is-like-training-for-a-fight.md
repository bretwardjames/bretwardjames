### "Everybody has a plan until they get punched in the face."

That quote is commonly attributed to Mike Tyson, but I'm pretty sure Mike's opponents understood this better than he ever did. Either way, I can personally verify that this is absolutely true.

Once that first bell rings, and the adrenaline hits you, all of your plans go right out the window. It's almost like you lose control of your brain.

In that moment, when it comes down to it, you do what you’ve trained yourself to do. It doesn’t matter what you _think_ you’ve trained yourself to do - you will do what you’re trained to do.

I had three fights earlier this year, and in each of them I thought I was preparing for different things.

The first guy I knew was bigger than me, so I the plan was to move around, throw a lot of kicks, and rely on my cardio. But once that bell rang, all of those plans a schemes went out the window, and I defaulted to what I’d actually been training myself to do: clinch.

The second fight was against a shorter guy. The strategy (which I worked hard on the week of that fight) was to stay long, throw a lot of jabs and teeps, and pick him apart from the outside.

But again. Bell goes ding, and I revert back to clinch.

The third fight, I wanted to do more boxing. But again, once that bell rang, I defaulted back to what was comfortable: clinch.

I go back to what I know because for better or worse, I’ve trained myself to default back to clinching.

The punch line of all of this is that how you react when crisis hits is directly related to the _training _you've put in beforehand.

You have to train, so that when the crisis hits, you can rely on your _instincts_ to carry you until you can quiet your mind enough to solve the problems.

The worst thing you can do is pretend those days don't (or won't) exist. The people that get knocked out the worst are the ones that don't take their opponent seriously. Same is true for business. The more impervious you think you are to bad times, the more vulnerable you actually are.

The way to win is to prepare yourself.

Winners train for battle.

Losers don't even know the battle is coming.

What are you training yourself to do?
