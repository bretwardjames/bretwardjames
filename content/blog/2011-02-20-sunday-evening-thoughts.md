This week has been one of reflection, as you can probably tell from my posts. Now, at the end of the week, I am thinking back on the week and I'm having even more thoughts (go figure). Here they are:




I've decided that, at the end of the day, life is about relationships. The only things that seem to really matter to people are their relationships with other people. We always hear stories about the rich people that don't find solace in their money because they end up all alone with it, or the Hollywood stars who do crazy things because they don't have real friends to turn to. Those stories never really sunk in for me.




But recently, as you may know if you've read the more recent posts on this blog, I've had a similar sort of experience myself. I thought that I was alone, without real friends who care about me as a person and who consider me important to them. I felt like I had a lot of people that I consider friends and who are very important to me, but not many who felt that way about me. Suddenly, the whole being alone thing was very personal. I was understanding, for myself, what it feels like to really feel alone and isolated from people. It wasn't a fun feeling.




Then Thursday happened, and I started thinking a little differently. I started to realize that I have a lot of people who may not be in my life every day, but who still have my back when it comes down to it. People who I didn't realize still remembered who I was, or people who I thought were just happy to be rid of me, sending me notes of encouragement and support. I realized that you don't have to see or hear from these kinds of people for them to support you. These are the people that, regardless of the incredibly stupid things you do or the way you act, somehow see something worth knowing and befriending in you, and don't run off when the going gets tough or you really need a hand with something. Then I came to the following thought:




Life is about the relationships you build and maintain. It's not about the money you make, or the songs you write, or the pictures you paint, or the diseases you cure, or any of that. It's all about the people that have your back. It's all about having those people's back. It's all about those real, deep relationships that go beyond just the initial utility of having a certain person as a friend. It's about making connections with someone else, and creating that bond.




I've come to realize that, to me, the most important thing in life are those relationships. Having felt as though I'd lost them, I appreciate them so much more now.




Moral of the story:




Take a look at your relationships. Are you putting enough effort into the important relationships in your life? Are you making an effort to be on good terms with your family, and keep in touch with them? Are you really trying to help your close friends realize how important they are to you? Are you sincerely making an effort to show your spouse (if you have one) how important they are to you? If you're not, you should stop to think about how important those relationships are to you, and you'll realize that you need to put in that effort before you're left with nothing.




I know I haven't done well at this at all, which I think is why I was so down on myself this week. Save yourself the grief of having to go through that, and make those real connections.




You'll be surprised at how much happier you'll be if you do.




You'll regret it if you don't.
