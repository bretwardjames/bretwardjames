They call me amateur,Who, from lofty perch of minded tradition
Portray well the way of the ancients and
Continue on as is the expectation.
With citation of Byron and quotation of Shakespeare
Flowing, eloquent, rehearsed and delivered,
Bely they the foundation
Upon which rest all thought to which they claim ownership.




I must confess,
I do not share their understanding and knowledge.
Nor do I claim to hold even a match-light to the passionate flame of Byron.
I do not bend to my will my native tongue
With near the strength of mighty Shakespeare.




But this is not what I wish to do.




They call me amateur,
And yet I do what all whom they revere have done.
I need not Byron to feel passion.
I need not Shakespeare to speak my heart.
I need but a pen and a thought,
And the world my voice shall hear.




My voice the world shall hear,
Not that of other men.




The pens of yore, though good and well,
Can tell no tales of where I dwell.
My life, my love, this small crusade,
Can by me, only, be portrayed.
