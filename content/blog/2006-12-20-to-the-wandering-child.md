O thou wanderer Thine heart in doubt, 
Whither thou goest 
Knowest thou not? 
This path that thou treadest, 
With darkness beset, 
Leadeth not to that rest, 
Which thou wishest to get.




O thou wanderer, 
Thou goest to and fro 
Searching here and searching there, 
But for what, thou dost not know. 
O beloved daughter, 
Seest thou the end? 
Treacherous is the resolution 
Of that trail which you descend.




O thou wanderer, 
Wilt thou suffer long? 
Come with me, I pray thee 
And listen to my song. 
O dearest child 
Wilt thou not sing? 
Wist ye not that thou 
Art a child of the King?
