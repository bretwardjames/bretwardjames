I want to start by saying I've worked with a LOT of business owners whose right-hand man (or woman) was their husband (or wife), and I can count on 2 fingers the number of times it's worked really well. Here are some tips to make it work better. A lot of these principles apply when working with other family members or even old friends.


# Technicolor Type A




The first thing you need to realize is that you are probably both pretty strong-willed and want to be in charge. You both have a vested interest in the success of the business, and therefore are both going to push very hard for what you think is the right thing to do. You both want it to succeed, and you're both driven to make it happen. Just understanding this won't avert every possible problem that you might face, but it's like that saying: knowing is half the battle.




# Pecking Order




Probably the hardest thing for spouses to get over in a business setting is the natural and essential pecking order. In fact, some business owners that work with spouses avoid setting that chain of command on purpose. This is a devastating mistake! Here is the plain truth – if you're going to be successful in the marketplace, you _have_ to have a clear leader and a clear follower, and you both have to be on the same page _always_! That doesn't mean you always have to agree, but one of you has to be in charge in the workplace and the other needs to respect that and get in line when necessary.




# Stop Apologizing




In business, personal feelings come second. It's important to treat your employees (including spouses) right, but that doesn't mean you don't bring up important stuff just because you might hurt your spouse's feelings. You need to be able to be perfectly blunt and honest with your spouse, and they need to be able to take it and process it effectively – otherwise it simply won't work. I can't tell you how many couple-business partners I've worked with that are constantly apologizing to each other for what they need to say. You wouldn't apologize like that to the college student that you hired as an intern; don't do it to your spouse either.




# See Your Spouse as an Employee (or Boss)




That brings me to my last point – in the context of the business, you must be able to see your spouse as an employee (or boss), and treat them as such. If you can't do that, or if your spouse will resent you for it, one of you _needs_ to go. And I beg you, for the sake of your marriage, don't let the business come between you. It is _not_ worth it!




# The Hardest Pill to Swallow




Humility. It's hard enough to be humble, but for some reason it's that much harder when you're in close proximity to your spouse at work. Whether you're in charge or an employee in the business, being humble with your spouse can seem nigh unto impossible. Here's the kicker – most of the time the reason why it's so hard to be humble with your spouse is your own insecurity. Ask yourself the hard question – are you insecure and afraid to be vulnerable to your spouse at work? Do you find yourself getting really defensive and argumentative in meetings, and sometimes at home? If so, you should not be working together.




I think it's possible to work with family members and make it work wonderfully. I've worked directly with family members most of my life, and aside from a few hiccups here and there it has worked out great. It's definitely not easy, but it is possible. It just takes more work J
