Many philosophers debate about what kinds of knowledge we can be sure about, or what counts as knowledge. In fact, they created an entire philosophical discipline dedicated to trying to figure that out. I’m not going to try and delve too far into that field, but I do have a theory that relates.




The big problem of Epistemology, at least as I see it, is that there is no real way to prove that we can know anything. Skepticism attempts (and is largely successful, in my opinion) to reduce all attempts at showing knowledge to simple misperception by our frail and untrustworthy senses. Really, one can answer any assertion of knowledge with a simple denial of the dependability of the senses. After all, it is possible that each of us exists only in a metaphysical sense, not actually subsisting in the physical, tangible sense. It’s kind of a complicated thing to consider, but it’s unfortunately impossible to disprove.




On the other hand, Skepticism has no way of completely denying knowledge, because it can’t really explain our thoughts. Descartes even talked about how everything reduces back to one's thoughts. So on the one hand, we can’t prove that we can know anything about the physical world, but we at least have to be able to know our own thoughts. What this boils down to is that although it’s impossible to show that most of our perception is unable to result in knowledge in us, there is something that results in knowledge in us. And I came up with a theory to explain it. (Sounds kind of quaint when I put it like that)




It’s actually pretty simple I think. Much like the rule of significant figures restricts the accuracy of a mathematical equation to its least precise component; the sureness of knowledge corresponds inversely with the number of physical media through which a proposition must travel before it reaches the mind. Simple, right?




Let’s see if I can break this down. A proposition (I’ll use the term to mean any idea or concept) makes its way to the mind through a variety of different media. For example, the proposition that there is a wall in front of me must travel through the medium of my eyes, optic nerve, and then has to be processed by my brain in order for me to comprehend it. However, what if the wall is just an optical illusion? Maybe it’s one of those hologram things, in which case I can’t really say I know that there’s a wall in front of me, because there isn’t. And every time I approach a wall like that, I have to consider the possibility that there isn’t actually a wall there, but rather the medium is messed up. By the same token, if I see a picture of something, or even better if I see something on TV, that adds a whole myriad of media through which the proposition, whatever it is that I’m seeing, must pass before it reaches my mind and I comprehend it. The theory becomes clearer as we examine the following example:




The game Telephone is a perfect example of how this works. The more people the phrase has to go through before the end, the more likely it is that the phrase will get messed up along the way somehow. So the closer you are to the original person that started the game, the more likely you are to get the original phrase. In the same way, the closer to the actual proposition the mind is, the more sure the knowledge is.




Now for the fun part.




It might seem like the closest that you can get to a proposition is to be standing right in front of it, but in fact the proposition can be much closer than that. In fact, the closest that you can get to a proposition is simply to think it. Of course, the thought has to come from the mind itself, not from any kind of outside stimulus. So if you see a wall, and then think, there’s a wall, it is still external knowledge. However, if you just think and come up with an original idea, about anything, that is the closest that you can get to the proposition, and is when knowledge is actually sure.




So, to sum up, only trust yourself  :)
