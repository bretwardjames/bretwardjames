Every once in a while, when you're driving late at night, turn off the music and just listen to the city. You'll be surprised at what happens.




I actually did this one time. It's a fairly short story, but it illustrates the point I think.




One night I was driving home late and as usual, had my music on way loud and was just having a great time, and then I remembered what Dad always said about turning the music off, so at one intersection, I decided to try it. I turned off the music, and because my windows were down, immediately realized why Dad suggested that. The night has a music of its own, and everyone should have a chance to experience it. It works best when you are the only person on the road, but in general the idea is the same. 




Try it. All growing up, and even today, I have loved listening to music, and I especially love listening to it loud. It would take too long to go into why that is, so let's just let that be that. When I started driving, it was like heaven because when I drive it's like free time to listen to music. Anyway, before my mission, I came home fairly late every night, and so often I would be driving down an empty road just blasting my music, having a great time.




Whenever Dad was driving with me, however, he made sure that the music was either really soft or off, and he would tell me how he would have his greatest inspiration while driving when there was nothing on. He had even made the change earlier from music to talk radio, and he gave up talk radio for silence. Dad always says that modern society is afraid of silence, and so we fill up as much of our time as possible with noise. He talks a lot about the different types of noise that we use to fill the space in our lives, and he always talks about how noise keeps us from receiving revelation from God. I'd like to shed a little bit of light on that idea.




I still like driving with the music loud, but I still turn it off every once in a while. During those times when the music is loud, I've noticed how often I miss phone calls because I can't hear my phone. In fact, it's not just when I'm driving. I like to play my guitar really loud, and I like to play alone to really loud songs, and I can almost never hear my phone ring. It has become a problem from time to time. This is an interesting example because it doesn't take too much of a stretch to give it very clear application. Noise in life crowds out the Spirit. Sometimes it's not even that what we are doing is bad, it's just so loud that we can't hear when the Spirit whispers. We should turn down the volume to the point that we can at least hear the cell phone. Interesting that we don't necessarily have to turn the music completely off to hear that phone go off.




In life we have so much to worry about that many times we find ourselves so swamped with good (and bad) noise that we sometimes miss our "phone calls". (this paragraph is meant to be very ambiguous) We miss out on more than we think when that happens. Those calls aren't always from the Spirit, many times they come from our families, our friends, our co-workers, and just people around us. The family on the side of the freeway with a flat tire, the homeless man whom we see every day, that friend who keeps calling because they really really need someone to just listen for a while - we either ignore the call or just send it to voicemail, because there is too much noise for us to see the importance of the call. We have a lunch meeting that weâ€™re late for, or a date that we want to be early for, or we don't want to get our nice clothes dirty, or we don't want to waste the time by stopping, or we have so much homework to do, or we think that our needs are greater than their needs. I don't say any of this to judge anyone, and I really believe that all of those things are noble causes. Meetings are good things to be on time to, it's good to be a little early for a date, it's not wise to ruin all of your clothes, time is money, homework is very important, and sometimes we really do have greater needs than those around us. The point, I think, is that sometimes we have to forget ourselves and think of others first. The only way we can hear when others call, however, is if we turn down the noise enough to hear the phone ringing.




(the ironic thing is that I would do well to apply this very lesson in my own life more)
