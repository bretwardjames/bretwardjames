Brad took a much more direct approach in his teaching, and frankly I loved his teaching method. It reminded me of Brigham Young, and I think that I have followed a lot in his footsteps. He was all about no-nonsense, just get it done tactics, and there was usually less psychology and reasoning and more just doing, which we'll get to in the next lesson. Very often he would point out that the answers to most of life's questions are fairly widely known, but people don't recognize them because they are so common place. He really taught me how to be practical and take a direct approach to life. He didn't mess too much with philosophy or deep thought; he just went to it and acted, and his lessons were all about doing something and less about philosophizing or deep thinking. It wasn't that he never thought deeply about things, however. It was just more that all deep thoughts for him were and are directly connected to an actual action.




I find it very interesting that there is usually a distinct difference between people who have just left school and entered a certain field and those who have been in the field for a while. A perfect example of this is the army or a mission. Straight out of boot camp or the MTC, many "greenies" still have no idea what they are doing, even though those people just spent 3 months non-stop studying what they would be doing. Those missionaries and soldiers that have more experience, however, are much more capable and adept. This has nothing to do with natural ability or intelligence; it has everything to do with the distinct difference between a conceptual understanding of something and a practical understanding with an application. You can't learn the piano by studying the motions of the fingers and the sounds of the piano. The only way to learn the piano is to sit down and actually play. You can't learn to play baseball just from watching it on TV your whole life. You have to get a mitt and a ball and go play!




Now, by the same token, you can't expect to learn to play baseball without ever watching a game or asking someone how to play. You can't really learn to play the piano well if you've never heard anyone play or never studied the keys or sounds of the piano itself. This is just to point out that life is not all action and no study, because learning is the precursor to all action. The point is to not get caught up in reading about how to sing, just go sing!




This principle extends into when we are not just trying to be able to do something, but also when we are trying to become something or someone. Becoming is not a mental thing. Becoming someone or something is a physical thing. It's an action. Instead of trying to study up on how to be a salesperson, just go sell something. Instead of trying to read on how to be a good parent, just go be a good parent! Instead of spending countless hours contemplating the best way to be honest, just be honest!




The point, as I have applied it, is that there is a time and place and correct duration for thought and contemplation, and then there is a point where you just need to get up and act. In conclusion, look before you leap, but if you look for too long you'll probably fall in.
