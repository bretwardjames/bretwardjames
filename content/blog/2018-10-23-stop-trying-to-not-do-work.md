title: Stop trying to not do work

For the last decade, we've been brainwashed (myself included, by the way) into thinking that charging more for less work was the way to scale.

Hell, I have taught that same principle from stage on multiple occasions. I totally bought into the culture of charging more 'because you can'.

Why do we do that?

Wanna know what I think? I think it's because we are deathly afraid of the one thing we should be embracing more than anything else:

WORK

Why? Because we actually believe that "work" is an entry level position. We believe it's the part of running a business that you outsource.

We're "CEOs", so if we're working 18 hour days, or if we can't travel 4 months of the year, we haven't "made it". Success is defined by how LITTLE we have to work (or so we think).

Can you imagine if Mohammed Ali had the same attitude toward boxing? Can you imagine him trying to outsource the cardio, the road work, the endless bag rounds, or the jump rope? Do you think for one second that you'd even know his name if he was always trying to do the least amount of work possible?

I remember training for one of my tournament fights when this really clicked for me. I was watching a video on Instagram of Joe Schilling, a very well-known kickboxer and an idol of mine. He threw up during training because the workout was so intense and he was going so hard.

That's when it hit me - the training never gets easier. You just get better.

Same thing is true in business. You're never going to do "less work". You're just going to get more done in the time you spend. And what you do in that time is going to get better.

But the minute you phone it in in your business, you're finished. The minute you start to replace yourself for the sake of "personal freedom" or "free time", you're done.

Just like in fighting, there's always a kid that's as hungry or more than you, and if he outworks you, it's all over. You're toast.

Don't phone it in. Forget "lifestyle business".

Do the f***ing work.

Or you'll get knocked out.
