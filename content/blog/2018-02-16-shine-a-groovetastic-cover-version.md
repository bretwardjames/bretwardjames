A reimagined version of Collective Soul's "Shine".

A lot of cover artists take a minimalist approach, stripping the song down to its essentials and playing simple chords with excellent vocalisms.

I like to be different (because I'm crazy) so this is a small example of a more lateral reimagining of one of the greatest songs of all time.

Enjoy
