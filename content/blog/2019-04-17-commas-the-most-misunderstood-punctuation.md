I wish it weren't true, but the vast majority of people simply don't understand how commas and other various grammatical
instruments work. Some say it doesn't matter (they're called descriptivists, i.e. wrong), as the only thing that matters 
is getting your point across. \

Problem is, they don't taking into consideration the fact that other people have to _understand_ what they're trying
to say. And more often than not you end up with problems like this: \

For those who don't understand how apostrophes work, that could be interpreted as "Love Trump's Hate", meaning  love
the hate that Trump is spreading, even though in reality it means exactly what it says: Love Trumps Hate (love is 
more powerful than hate). \

The classic example, of course, is the slow children sign: \

Which of course _means_ "_Slow_. Children at play." But it can easily be interpereted to mean "_Slow children_ at play"
