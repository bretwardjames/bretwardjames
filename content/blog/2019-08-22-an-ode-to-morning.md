I am a morning person. As tired or grumpy as I may be - the morning is always a time of calm and reflection. 

So much so that I got all artsy fartsy about it.

Peter McKinnon, if you ever see this, two things:

1. Your videos are the chief inspiration behind even thinking to make this.
2. I may have kind of ripped off your style directly. It's meant as a compliment :)
