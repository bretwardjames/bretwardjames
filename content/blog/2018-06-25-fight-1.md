Since I got started training Muay Thai, I've gotten a lot of different types of reactions from people who have known me my whole life. Everything from dumbfounded surprise to concerned criticism to unabashed pride.

For a long time, I tended to ignore the surprise and the criticism and revel in the pride, telling myself that since I viewed this newfound lifestyle as a complete positive, anyone that didn't share that view wasn't worth listening to.

Last night I had a conversation that gave me a different perspective on it.

So, I wanted to take some time and put down "on paper" what it is about the "Brutal Ballet" that is so important to me and what drives me to get into a ring and try to knock another dude out while he tries to do the same.

As I started writing, however, it became clear that there is a lot more I want to say than can be summed up in one post (at least not one that people will read), so I'm going to break it up into sections. First I'll set the scene with my back story, and then I'll go through each of my main reasons for fighting, and then do a conclusion post where I wrap it all up.

Sounds fun, right?

## Back Story: Ferdinand the Bull

This is an excerpt from a real book about a bull that didn't want to fight:

<blockquote>Once upon a time in Spain...there lived a bull and his name was Ferdinand.</blockquote>

<blockquote>All of the other little bulls in the pasture loved to run around and butt their heads together, but not Ferdinand. Ferdinand preferred to just sit quietly and smell the flowers. He had a favorite spot in the shade under a cork tree in the pasture. He would sit there all day long and sit just quietly and smell the flowers.</blockquote>

<blockquote>His mother, who was a cow, asked him if he wanted to play and butt heads like the other little bulls but Ferdinand said no, he preferred to just sit quietly and smell the flowers. His mother, who was very understanding, even though she was a cow, decided to just let him be happy there under the cork tree.</blockquote>

<blockquote>After a while Ferdinand grew into a big, strong bull. All of the other bulls in the field still ran around and butted their horns together. What they wanted more than anything in the world was to be chosen from the big bull fights in Madrid. But not Ferdinand, he preferred to just sit quietly and smell the flowers. One day, a group of men from Madrid came to the pasture to choose a bull for the bull fight. All of the bulls were so excited and proudly showed off how tough they were by butting their heads together and acting very fierce. Ferdinand knew he would not be chosen so he left to go sit under his cork tree in the shade.</blockquote>

The story goes on to tell how he got sucked into a fight because he freaked out after sitting on a bee, so everyone thought he was the toughest bull in Spain, but then he just sat there in the stadium and refused to fight.

We actually had this book when I was a kid and I read it quite often, but the real reason I bring this up is that I was often referred to by my family as Ferdinand. I played in a youth soccer league and spent more time chasing butterflies than the ball. I was never really that overtly competitive and I most definitely avoided conflict like the plague.

So I guess it should come as no surprise that people who grew up with me would consider it slightly odd that I would take up the most directly confrontational sport on the planet.

I think it's slightly romantic, the notion that Ferdinand would refuse to fight even when he was finally thrust into it. Seeing the lights, hearing the roar of the crowd, smelling the sweat of the matador all had no effect on him. He still just wanted to sit and smell the flowers.

It's easy to give in to the way that story is told, making it seem like it's not only romantic, but it's also right in some way. It's easy to make that connection since the practice of bullfighting is absolutely ridiculous and inhumane. Ferdinand didn't want to fight, so why should we make him do it? He just wants to sit in the field and smell flowers, and that's sweet, so let's let him do it.

Most people would probably say that this story has a happy ending, because Ferdinand wasn't forced to fight to the death for the entertainment of a sick group of humans. I disagree, however. Not with the sickness of bullfighting, that's gotta go, but with it being a happy ending for Ferdinand. If he was never challenged to step outside his comfort zone and make something of himself, how would he ever grow as a person?

How would Ferdinand grow up to be anything different from a 28-year-old man living in his parents' basement playing video games all day? How would he ever learn to be confident in his own abilities and actually play a functioning role in society?


 
   

 


He absolutely wouldn't. He'd become conditioned that the world owed him that little spot under the cork tree with flowers all around. He'd take for granted all that goes into maintaining that field so the flowers grow, and making sure the irrigation keeps that cork tree healthy. He'd completely lose sight of the WORK that goes into the cushy life he enjoys, and one day, when the caretaker gets either too old or too fed up with being taken for granted, Ferdinand would be out in the streets with no skills, no ambition, no ability to make money, and would spend the rest of his miserable existence blaming the world around him for his misfortunes.

Now, obviously there is a _lot_ to unpack there, which is most of the reason I'm taking 5 posts to do so. So I will explain. No, there is too much. I will sum up:

So why do I get in the ring and fight?

Because I realized that getting in the ring is just a metaphor.

_Life _is the real fight.

And life _is_ fighting.

Think about it: life is _fighting._
