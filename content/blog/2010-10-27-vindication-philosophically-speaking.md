Today has been a good day for philosophy and me. Over the past few weeks, our relationship has been pretty rocky, but there have been a few really good days that have made it worth it. Today has become a sort of day of vindication for the whole idea of me as a philosophy major. That of course doesn't mean that I love everything about philosophy or even agree with what's being taught. I just feel serious confirmation that I'm in the right place, studying in a field that I nowÂ realize I was born and bred for.




Let me explain. No, there is too much. Let me sum up:




My frustration with philosophy, at least my most recent frustration with it, has been that my philosophy courses are seriously kicking my trash. I swear, there have never been classes where I honestly felt like no matter how hard I studied, I still wouldn't fully comprehend the material. (History tells us that I just didn't study at all). Its incredibly frustrating to never have taken a class where halfway through it, you still have trouble explaining to people what you're studying in the class. I'm a fairly intelligent individual, at least intelligent enough to understand the basic concept of a class (or just fake it), but in this case, I find myself unable to do either. Part of it may come from the fact that for most of my education up to this point, the material in any given class has been such that I could to some extent derive the basic understanding from something that I'd already learned. In other words, if I added all of my other learning together, and made some deductions, I could usually come up with whatever we were talking about in the class.




I have officially reached the end of such derivations.




But enough about my frustrations. I have some thoughts brewing about the parallel between Plato's allegory and my situation, but those are thoughts for another time.




My vindication came today at 2 separate times, in similar ways:




Back story:




In high school, among a lot of other things that I thought about, I had a particular thought that many of you will find familiar. I want to preface this by saying that the first time I ever read anything by Rene Descartes was here at BYU, way after high school. My thought was this:




Suppose I were to retract my thoughts back away from the physical world, away from touch, sight, smell, and other sensory experience. Suppose I were to retract so far into myself that I would not even interact with my own brain. Suppose I were to retract so far away from everything physical that I would suddenly be observing the physical world from outside the physical world. Needless to say, I supposed this, and then I came to the following, startling idea. What if, instead of a spirit inside of a physical body, interacting with a physical world that actually subsists, I in fact am simply my internal thoughts and feelings, and the physical world is nothing more than a complicated virtual reality, designed to test my innermost feelings and desires and providing for every possible situation that a real physical world would present. To put it in simpler terms, what if God didn't actually create physical worlds and plants and trees and the like, but rather created a complex combination of concepts and ideas that mimic what a physical world would be like, and then subjected all of us to it.




From that, I thought that maybe instead of every being created by God having a place in this reality, He created this particular reality for me only, and every aspect of this universe except my own thoughts and feelings and desires (and in some subsequent situations, my actions) were actually controlled by Him. In other words, what if everything around me does not actually exist, including all the people in the world, but instead I have been placed in this situation to learn show how I would act in this type of situation. I obviously could go on, but further development of this theory would take forever, and would inevitably bore whoever is reading this. And I haven't even got to the interesting part of this post yet.




More back story:




While I was serving as a missionary in Ukraine, as I was approaching the end of my mission, I began assembling and committing to paper some of the things that I had learned thus far. One of these lessons, and something that I've written about here on this blog, is the idea that it's more important to focus on the why of actions, rather than on the action itself. In other words, instead of only focusing on doing good things, one should try to become a good person. I've also written about how the only way to become good at anything is to practice. I wrote about how, in order to become a good basketball player, one must practice basketball, and in order to become honest, one must simply be honest. While these theories, when juxtaposed in this way, seem to create a contradiction, or rather a circular argument, today I realized that I'm not the only person to have come up with this particular argument.




The vindication:




In 1641, Rene Descartes published his Meditations, which at least partially contain an argument very similar to the one that I came up with in high school. I did not hear it from him before I came up with it, rather we both came to that same conclusion. The same thing happened with Aristotle's view on virtue. Around 330 BC, Aristotle wrote the Nichomachean Ethics, which in its second book explains essentially the exact theory that I came up with on my mission. Again, I had never read Aristotle until this past week, and yet was able to formulate a theory almost identical to one of the most well-known and respected philosophers of all time.




I say all of this not to brag that I have some great mind and that I should be revered, but rather to point out that these discoveries have given me a serious amount of confidence in my own ability not only to survive in the philosophical world, but to maybe even do really well. It helps me to see that I think in much of the same way as many of these great philosophers, and while I may not understand all of philosophy, I do have the mind and aptitude for it.




Now to work my bootay off so I can make good use of all of this.
