Why, stupid? You don't know them!




I've been on both ends of this one enough to know a few things about why you shouldn't do this. Negativity is never a really good thing, mostly because the whole idea behind negativity is the exact opposite of positive. While there are some who try to convince themselves and others that what is negative is actually good for them, the truth remains that negative always leaves you with less, while positive leaves you with more. It's like trying to add negative five to ten to get fifteen. It will never happen. You can write down fifteen as the answer, and even be convinced that it's the right answer, but when the grades come in, you will have gotten it wrong. And yet people still continue to choose the negative and love to find everyone else's faults.




The first point I'd like to make is that any person who talks negatively about someone else without taking the time to actually get to know that person is an absolute idiot. That sounds kind of harsh, and may offend some, but welcome to reality people. The plain fact of the matter is that until you know a person, you have no idea why they do what they do. How often do we get upset with someone about something only to then find out the reason why they acted that way, leaving us feeling really stupid and sorry. For example, your co-worker is always a few minutes late for work and always seems to get away with it, and so you go to complain to your boss, and it's explained to you that this particular co-worker is taking care of her father who had a stroke, and who also happens to be the single mother of 3 little kids. She sacrifices precious time with her children in the mornings to make sure that her father is comfortable, and then has to hurry her children out the door for school before rushing to work. Not only does she have these issues, but, you find out, she is the highest performing worker in your department, but refuses to be recognized because she doesn't want the attention. How do you feel now? I'd feel pretty stupid. How can any person assume to know everything surrounding any other person's decisions? There's only one answer. They can't.




Think about how you would feel if you had to make a tough decision and you found out later that people were criticizing your decision behind your back. For example, let’s say you are that single mom with the father who had a stroke, and you decide that he needs to be put in a care home, because you need to spend more time with your kids, and you find out that a co-worker has been criticizing your decision, saying that you should just make more time for your kids, not dump your father off in some facility. How much would that hurt, especially when you've spent months agonizing over that decision? You knew you had to do it, and it was already hard for you to even make that decision, but then to find out that people were criticizing your decision without even knowing what was going on? I know I would want to sit them down and chew them out, but most of the time you don't want to have to explain yourself to everyone you meet, just so they won't hate you from the get-go.




The real point here is this: Don't talk negatively about people you don't know, because it just causes pain all around. Be positive, and for crying out loud, give people the benefit of the doubt!
