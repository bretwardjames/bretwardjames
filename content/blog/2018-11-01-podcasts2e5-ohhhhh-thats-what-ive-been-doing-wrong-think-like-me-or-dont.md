Alcoholics or addicts of any kind are taught to completely remove the offending substance from their life. And stay away from them like the plague and create an alternative lifestyle because they are powerless. For some reason, that particular vice has power over them.

And I think for me, it's credit.

Credit, both the financial and metaphorical version of credit, has been a huge vice, something that I've never really managed well. I've really abused it and I haven't treated it right, because I don't really understand what it actually is.

The idea of credit has given me a false sense of affordability around things that are not affordable. This idea of credit leads me to believe that even though I have no cash, I still have money.

Part of that is just a lack of education. But I think I think a lot of addiction comes from a lack of proper education.

When I first started drinking, I was terrified that I was gonna become addicted immediately because I thought I had an addictive personality. But I've had so much education around the dangers of of alcohol addiction that I feel like I have power over it.

With finances, though, I think a lot of the reason why I'm in the financial position I am right now is because personally, I don't understand how money works. I have always been of a mind that money is just numbers, it's just a number in an account somewhere. And that's it. And I’ve overly simplified what money actually is to the point where I don't have any real understanding of the consequences of abusing it.

I had this attitude: pay a credit card because that's money I get back. So I prefer to pay a credit card bill over some other bill like insurance or whatever because the credit card bill is money that I can use again.

The problem with that is I consider my cash plus my credit as my cash limit. So I’m always maxed out on all my cards.

I have always been, as literally as you possibly can be, living paycheck to paycheck

Here’s how I plan to solve that:

I'm going to drastically reduce my personal salary in the business,

I'm going to plan out, in very realistic terms, the growth of the business: what I want to have happen over the next 3, 6, 12 months. And based on my personal ability to actually get myself there, I'm going to give myself performance reviews. So essentially, every quarter, I'm going to take a look at my performance. And if I hit all of my numbers at all my metrics, then I'm gonna get a raise. So that's how I build my own personal income.

But the important thing is that I'm only going to be doing reviews every quarter, which means raises aren’t going to happen every month. In fact, I think it's actually a full year to get to a realistic salary.

Everything and everybody in a business needs to have a metric is that they are responsible for. So if they don't hit their numbers, the compensation goes down, or at least doesn't increase.

I have been pondering junctions like this where I've had some sort of mental breakthroughs and some sort of new understanding a new new lease on life. But I have these experiences where I'll think my way to a solution.

And historically, I have a tendency to think that my work is done once I've thought of the solution. Like somehow just coming up with the idea is enough, and I should be rewarded in some way for my ingenuity. And I don’t do the same for the execution of the idea.

And it's an interesting, contradiction. Because I have always prided myself on being very focused on execution.

And yet, for some reason, with a lot of these ideas, I never end up making it past the planning phase. I'll get really gung ho on this idea, this thing that I decided I'm going to go do and then I just give up. Like I've used all my energy on coming up with the idea and none of my energy actually doing it.

The key is in the execution. Don’t stop with just an idea.
