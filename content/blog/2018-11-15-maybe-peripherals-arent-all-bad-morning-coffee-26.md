I've raved against depending on peripherals lately, but I think there is a caveat to that. I think depending on tools and gadgets can be fine if they are actually essential to the finished product.  
  
But most of the time, we just hide behind them in an attempt to hide the actual product.  
  
I have been as guilty (if not MORE) than anyone of hiding behind fancy gizmos so that the real me wasn't exposed, because I wasn't very confident in myself.  
  
But at the same time, I have always DEMANDED of myself that I can be capable of doing anything, from anywhere, at any time. And those same tools that I've hid behind and used as an excuse have been crucial to my ability to hold myself to that standard.  
  
So I guess I consider those tools and gadgets to actually be a part of me, an extension of me. They allow me to scale myself beyond what most people are capable of.  
  
But it forces me to walk a fine line between depending on those peripherals to the point where the core content is hidden and using those peripherals as what they are: tools.  
  
It's like a glove or a hat. Those can become extensions of who you are (think Michael Jackson's glove, or even the hats that I've been wearing a lot lately), but they are not who you are.  
  
They can help make a point, but they are not THE point. 

So maybe the point isn’t quite as extreme as get rid of all your peripherals, but rather, make sure you’re using them for what they are.
