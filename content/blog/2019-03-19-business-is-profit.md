I think we can all agree that entrepreneurship is at an all-time popularity-high right now, and that we've probably not
seen its peak yet. \

Personally, I think this is awesome. More and more people are leaving dead-end jobs and making something of themselves.
Not only is this good for them (as it allows them to discover and pursue their true passion), but it also is starting to
change the nature and definition of what a `job` is. (more on that in another post) \

As technology continues to evolve, we are faced with an increasing number of what I call `microproblems` (some people 
refer to these as `first world problems`): \

Now take a look at the above images. For a long time, these problems were just accepted as the side-effect of having
access to the technology that brought that problem. So the common response would be something like: \

```Yeah, the headphones are tangled, but you have HEADPHONES.``` 

or

```Ok, so the packaging is difficult to open, but that packge was delivered in 2 HOURS!``` 

or 

```Well at least you HAVE a zipper.```

or

```Would you rather NOT have a seatbelt?```

And I think for a long while, that attitude was fully acceptable. But today, with more and more resources available to
the common person, individuals can take on those problems that are `uniquely human`, and in a very real way, can create
a business and support themselves for life just by solving one small problem. \

And so we have the [tangle-free headphones](https://www.amazon.com/s?k=tangle-free+headphones&ref=nb_sb_noss_2) (or the 
slightly more advanced [bluetooth headphones](https://www.amazon.com/s?k=bluetooth+headphones&ref=nb_sb_noss_1)), 
so-called ["Frustration-Free Packaging"](https://www.amazon.com/gp/help/customer/display.html?nodeId=201910210), and
["Zuppies"](http://www.zuppies.com/). For the seat belt problem, most auto manufacturers just added a plastic cover to 
the seat belt buckle, so you don't have to handle the hot metal parts any more. \

This is really cool for a variety of reasons, and I think the success of smaller businesses like these has created an 
unprecedented draw of talent into the entrepreneurial world with the advent of the `side hustle`. \
