If you wanted a meatball sub, how many Subways would you be willing to visit in order to get it?

Seriously, think about it.

Let’s say the first subway you go to is out of bread.

The second is out of marinara sauce.

The third is out of meatballs.

The fourth is out of cheese.

Maybe you think after the second store, you’d probably just pick a different sandwich that they DO have.

Fair enough.

But what if it’s not YOU that wants it, but your pregnant wife? She has that craving, and nothing will satisfy it but a meatball sub from Subway.

And by the way, you can’t cheat and leave off any of the ingredients. Pregnant women (I’m told) can smell the difference before you even open the bag.

Methinks you’d be willing to hit every store on Yelp and off Yelp trying to find it.

Why don’t we treat our businesses that way?

How many different ad strategies are you willing to try to get your offer right?

How many different variations of the webinar slide deck are you willing to test?

How many different email subject lines are you willing to try to find the one that converts the best?

Sometimes you’ll get it right on the first try. Sometimes the first store you go to will have all the ingredients to make the perfect meatball sub. 

But if you’re not at least willing to go to another store to get it right, you’re working towards the wrong aim as a business owner. 

Getting it right on the first try is not something to strive for.

Get it right eventually. Test, learn, iterate, and innovate. (For example, buy the bread from the fourth Subway and bring it back to the first)
