I have a sneaking suspicion (based only on my own experience) that most frustration is actually based in insecurity.  

For example:  

At the beginning of 2017, I quit the marketing game altogether.  

I liked to say to myself that it was because I was fed up with the charlatanism and douchebagery that is so commonplace in the marketing world.  

And that was kind of true.   

Chicanery doth abound here.  

However, the larger reason why I left was out of fear.  

I had one major contract that was going away, and with it the bulk of my income.   

I hadn't done any marketing for myself, didn't have any leads in the pipeline, and had an "opportunity" to go do something else.  

I put opportunity in quotes because although I am incredibly grateful that I had that experience, I was really only using it as an excuse to not do the hard, grinding work of building my business up the right way.   

Then, 5 months later, I made the same insecure decision again.  

I was offered a job back in the marketing space, which seemed at the time to be a step up. Making way more money than I'd ever made before, and in theory, only doing the things that I like doing.  

I took the job, thinking that I was making a financial decision. Really, I was making a decision to avoid the grueling work that is necessary to make money as a kickboxing instructor.  

And then finally I rounded out the trio of insecure decision making by leaving that job. I told myself it was because I was being required to do too much and it wasn't worth it, but really it was because I wasn't willing to do the hard work necessary to make the position fit.  

All things considered, I don't regret any of those decisions, because I wouldn't be where I am today if I hadn't been through those situations and made those mistakes.  

But now, as I embrace the grind, as I lean into the 12-hour days and everything that goes along with building a brand, I see how my insecurity had more to do with those decisions than anything else.  

Not that the insecurity is gone, by the way. The difference is now I'm hustling in spite of the insecurity, instead of trying to skirt around it.
