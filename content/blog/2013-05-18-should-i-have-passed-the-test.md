I took a biology class in college. I was/am terrible at biology, in case you didn't know, so this example will be perfect. The date of the first exam was coming up, so I began to study in preparation for it.
Question: Should I have passed the test?




The obvious and probably first answer you'd think of is yes, I should have passed the test. We probably default to that because we all want to succeed and we want others to succeed, so it would make sense to think that I should have passed it. Let me throw in an unexpected variable:




Because I was/am terrible at biology, I didn't understand the material for this exam. I put in every last second that I possibly could to master the material, but when I went to take the test, I simply didn't get the material. I totally bombed the test.




Question: Should I have passed the test?




The two questions, although worded identically, are actually talking about two completely separate ideas. The first just refers to the general concept that we should pass our tests, whereas the second is asking whether, given the fact that I was unprepared for the test, I should have passed anyway.




Saying "One should pass one's tests" is akin to saying "One should run 100 meters in 10 seconds." Neither of those statements is inherently fallacious or untrue. We are all capable of achieving whatever goals we wish to achieve. The key is to realize that you can't expect yourself or anyone else to just run 100 meters in 10 seconds on sheer will power. You have to assume that you _can_ pass the test, in the same way that you would have to be able to assume that you _can_ run 100 meters in 10 seconds.




The hard part is the balance between accepting the fact that we aren't perfect and continuing to push ourselves to achieve our goals.




Tip: When you fail, realize that you simply don't have it yet and getting upset about it is a complete waste of time. Just keep working at it. It will come.




In other words: If at first you don't succeed, try, try again.
