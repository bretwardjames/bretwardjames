Entrepreneurship is NOT about "doing whatever you want".   

Sure, you get to choose the general direction of where you want to go, but once you've locked that in, you are extremely restricted in the day-to-day.  

You don't get to say,   

"I want to fight Conor McGregor in 6 months,"   

AND ALSO SAY  

"I want to sleep in today and go to the fair and have funnel cake."  

If you decide you want to fight Conor, you give up the freedom to have funnel cake.  

You've made the decision about the funnel cake when you make the decision about the fight.  

In the same way, when you decide to become an entrepreneur, you don't get to frolick around doing whatever you want (unless you've figured out how to make money frolicking, in which case, please call me and let me in on the secret - I want that shit).  

You either get to frolick or you get to be an entrepreneur.  

You either get funnel cake or you fight Conor.  

You DON'T get to do whatever you want - you get to do what it takes.
