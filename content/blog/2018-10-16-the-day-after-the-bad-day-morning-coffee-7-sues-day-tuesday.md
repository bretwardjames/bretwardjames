Sometimes the cure for stress and overwhelm is to just press on. 

In my case, a conversation about something completely unrelated with a friend I hadn't spoken to in nearly a decade brought me back around.  

Not saying it works every time, but having a distraction helps. And also, just keep swimming.  

The important thing is to not let the opportunity to learn and improve pass you by.   

Bad days are lessons.
