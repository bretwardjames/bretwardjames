An episode of 30 Rock (amazingly hilarious show) brought up a very interesting point. Two characters, one a black man (Tracy Jordan played by Tracy Morgan), and one a white woman (Jenna Maroney played by Jane Krakowski), argue over who has it "harder" in life because of social oppression, black people or women. The reach a point where to prove their respective points, they "switch places". Tracy Jordan dons makeup and a blond wig to become a white woman, while Jenna dresses up like a black man. I would like to point out that Jenna's get-up is far more convincing than Tracy's, but that has nothing to do with anything.




At this point, Jack Donaghy (Played by Alec Baldwin) appears on the chaotic scene and they both present him with their arguments as to why their particular situation is the more oppressed. His response:




"I'll tell you has it the hardest: White Men. We make the unpopular, difficult decisions, the tough choices. We land on the moon and Normandy beach and yet they resent us..."




I realize that this is a comical approach to the political issue, but I honestly agree with that. White men are blamed for all of the world’s problems, and are the first to be accused of racism and sexism. Never do you hear of a black or Hispanic accused of being racist. I have never heard of a woman being accused of being sexist. 




What I don't understand, and therefore absolutely reject, is the notion that there are certain phrases that automatically make a white man racist, but those same exact phrases used in the exact same context to convey the exact same message, if used by any other ethnicity, are totally and completely acceptable. We white men simply allow them to take advantage of us because evil and mistaken men who happened to share our skin color within the past few centuries mistreated good, upstanding men and women who share their skin color. I do not mean to demean or belittle the atrocities that have been committed against minorities, for I personally abhor the thought of racism. My issue is that I did not and have not committed a racist act in my entire life, and yet I constantly am having to change the way I speak in order to not become racist because of a single off-hand remark. Why should I be punished for the actions of men in another time, and another place? I firmly assert that I would have been opposed to racial prejudices and slavery had I lived in those times, just as I do now. Nothing of my upbringing or standing would have ever hinted at that being acceptable or right. 




Understand that I do not refer to any particular person of ethnic background with whom I currently share acquaintance in speaking like this, but I speak in general of the American public.




In conclusion, and again to avoid what could easily become a novel, I will summarize my point in one statement.




If you think I'm racist, you are racist.
