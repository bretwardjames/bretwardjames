A few weeks or so ago I decided to start a new set of goals and plans so that my Summer would be productive and satisfying. I decided on exercise, eating, reading, cleaning, and all other types of goals you can think of. I thought about how we needed to develop the discipline to get everything done every day so that when the Fall semester rolls around again, I will have made those good habits and they will stick.




I got to thinking about that, and I realized something very interesting. So often, we think of discipline as having the strength to say no in the face of temptation. (Temptation in this instance refers to anything that could go against any of our goals.) We think of all of the things we shouldn’t be doing, and develop the strength to not do them. We think of developing discipline as saving up strength to resist in those times of need. That means that discipline is a power to prevent. I realized, however, that it is something else entirely.




I believe that real discipline is having the ability to do, not just refrain from doing. Instead of just being able to say no to the bad things, discipline is how we say yes to the good things. I believe that real discipline is getting up every morning and making decisions that will put the actions of that day right where we need them. Discipline is taking positive control over one’s life, and doing all of the right things without even taking notice of all of the things one shouldn’t be doing. If a person focuses only on what should happen, and simply does those things, then there is no room for idleness, and therefore no room for temptation.




My simple point is that instead of focusing our disciplinary efforts on preventing bad, use that energy to actively choose the things that need to happen. Make positive, disciplined choices that will only lead you into situations where you are proactively reaching your goals, and then you don’t even have to waste your time thinking about all the bad that could happen.
