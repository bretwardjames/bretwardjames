I spent a good deal of time after I got back from Ukraine feeling very superior to everyone I met because I felt like I had “experience” of some kind. It seemed like everyone else I met was so stuck in their little bubble that they couldn’t see that there were other thoughts and ways of doing things. I think the biggest mistake I made was justifying my actions by telling people that they didn’t really know what “bad” was, because they hadn’t seen what I’d seen. If only I’d understood then what I am coming to understand now. 




I have seen a lot of things that I now wish I hadn’t. I’ve done a lot of things that I wish I hadn’t needed to do. I know things and have experienced things that have certainly made me more aware of the world and how things work in some places, but they have done nothing to make me a better person. They certainly haven’t made me any better than any other person I come in contact with, regardless of whether or not they’re more or less “experienced” than I am. 




Contrary to my own previous opinion and what is now fairly popular opinion, being sheltered is not ignorance, it’s innocence. At the end of the day, the most valued characteristic in humanity is just that, innocence. Being untainted by the world and all of the bad that’s out there, and just being pure and beautiful. I wish I could say that I was like that. I have to spend the rest of my life making sense of and filtering out all of the crap I’ve seen and done. I have an immense love and admiration for people who have been privileged to keep themselves sheltered from the garbage in the world, and most of that stems from honest envy. So again I ask the question, what’s wrong with being sheltered? 




*Please do not misconstrue this as an attack on those with more “experience”. This is purely a defense of the sheltered (innocent).
