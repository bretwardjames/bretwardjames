Trying something totally new on this one. The beat and electronic vibe didn't really speak to much to a melodic overlay, but you all should know by now how much I love hearing myself talk.

So I kind of put the two together.

Enjoy.

PS I'll have the full 2 hours of putting this song together this morning. Uncut, raw. It's kind of fun, actually.
