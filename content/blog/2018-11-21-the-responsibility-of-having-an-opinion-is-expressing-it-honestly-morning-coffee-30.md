I've always resisted the idea that you should keep your opinions to yourself when it will rock the boat or cause conflict.

I really dislike the idea of censoring my actual thoughts and feelings for the sake of some arbitrary standard of "peace".

I just don't think we have time for that.

Whether we allow ourselves to believe it or not - our time is limited, and every moment of growth that we waste by hiding our actual opinions and thoughts is a moment we can never get back.

And worse than that - training your mind to tell little white lies (regardless of the motive) changes the way you think. Before long, NOTHING YOU SAY is true. Everything you say to everyone becomes the rose-colored (false) version of events. 

I think we're afraid of not getting everything perfect every time. And we're afraid of the messiness. You can't predict everyone's opinion or their reaction to your opinion, so if everyone starts being honest, things can get really messy.

But life IS a mess. There's nothing clean or neat or predictable about it. So why are we trying to convince ourselves it should be anything but messy?

If you think something - you have a responsibility to the collective of humanity to express it. Or at the very least not try to pass yourself off has having a different opinion.

We as a whole, and you as an individual, WASTE opportunities for growth when we're not fully, openly, and bluntly honest with ourselves and others.

So take some responsibility, own up to your opinions, and embrace the mess.
