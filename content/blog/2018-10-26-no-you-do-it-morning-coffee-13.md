Just because you have a reason or an excuse for why your customers are upset with you doesn't absolve you of the responsibility of fixing it.  

I can't tell you how often I've been working with a client, something broke, and although it wasn't directly my fault, I had to take responsibility for fixing the problem.  

Even if there is no way that I could have foreseen that particular issue, it fell under the scope of my responsibility, and therefore I was responsible.  

At the end of the day, that relationship is not about me. It's about the client.  

Even more than I'm responsible for what actually happens for my clients, I am responsible for how my client feels about it.  

Just like in this situation, where our complex couldn't have foreseen what happened (let alone that it would happen 3 times), they were still responsible to us to make sure that we FEEL like it's being resolved.  

And by the way, you can never get away from that responsibility. After something like that goes wrong, you are always responsible for the fact that it happened.  

Most of the time that means you have to step up your communication, and sometimes it means you actually have to deliver more in order to make up for the difference.  

It's not very exciting, but it's part of the game.  

At the end of the day, it's about the CUSTOMER, not about you.   

Put yourself in THEIR shoes.
