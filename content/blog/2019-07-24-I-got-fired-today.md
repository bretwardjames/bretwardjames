Getting fired is strangely one of my favorite things ever.

I know that sounds weird, but it's true. 

Sure, it sucks real bad while it's happening, and it takes quite a while to recover from the pain and self-doubt that you feel from it, but in reality it is the best personal wake-up call you can get.

Think about it - if you get fired, it's because something is wrong, and you didn't notice in time.

It's the same as getting divorced (been there, done that, so I have a smidge of authority). People get divorced because they didn't realize there was a problem soon enough (or waited too long to fix it).

Either way, once the firing is done, you have space to reevaluate, adjust, and make better decisions in the future.

So here's to getting fired!
