"Company Culture" has become more and more of a commonplace consideration for companies. 

Seems like nowadays every company has their equivalent of an "open floor plan" or "cereal bar" or "game room".

And although I firmly believe that culture is a crucial part of a company's growth and expansion, I don't think people really understand what it actually is.

The culture that we built at Infusionsoft wasn't something that we created and forced people into. Infusionsoft's "Cereal Bar" wasn't something that we came up with as a way to boost morale.

It came because everyone who worked at Infusionsoft in the early days loved to eat cereal. Like loved loved. A lot.

So it made perfect sense that our cereal obsession would grow with the company. It was a natural extension of a shared interest (or in our case, obsession).

But more important than any of the "perks" of the culture, the leadership at Infusionsoft (Clate, Scott) has always been focused on the employees as individuals. 

They understood that the best way to grow their company was to empower each employee individually.

In the video I talk about how I was given some time off on short notice to pursue activities that were important to me at the time.

Clate took me aside on several occasions and asked me what I really wanted to be doing to see if there was a way for me to expand my actual interests into more than just answering support questions.

Culture starts with people, and that's something that I always felt was the case when I worked at Infusionsoft. It wasn't something that was imposed on us, it was just a natural extension of who we were at the time.

So if you want to create a culture that is people-focused, you have to be a person that is people-focused. Then attract other people that are also people-focused. 

Then you have a culture that is people-focused, not because you told everyone to be people-focused, but because everyone was already people-focused when they got there.
