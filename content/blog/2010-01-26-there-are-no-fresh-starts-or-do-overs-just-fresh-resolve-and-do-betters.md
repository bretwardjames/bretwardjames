With the New Year just past and everyone attempting to keep good on their new year’s resolutions, I think there is no better time for me to debut this little thought. I should preface this entire post with the fact that I have nothing against setting goals and I love the idea of setting resolutions for the New Year. I’m not advocating a change from that very worthwhile tradition, just a more accurate angle of approach.




Too often we look at setting goals and New Year’s resolutions as a “fresh start” or a chance to “do it over”. Because a new year is starting, this actually makes a lot of sense, because with a new year it seems as though everything starts over, and we’re given another chance. In fact, however, there are no such things as “fresh starts”. The fact of the matter is, life is one continuous round, and there is no way of “starting over” in the sense that all of the past just goes away and you are left with a completely clean slate. Even baptism is not a clean slate. It is true that God forgets and will not hold us accountable for our sins previous to baptism, but He doesn’t go back and remove them from the fabric of time, making it as thought they never happened. They are left so that we can effectively learn from them, having them constantly in our minds and memories.




Life is the sum of our experiences and actions. We may be proud of some, and not so proud of others, but we cannot and are not supposed to escape any of our past. The past creates the present. Remove any of the past, and the present ceases to be as we now know it. Remove any of the past, and we cease to exist as the people we are. We literally owe who and what we are to the past. My point here is that regardless of your past and situation, your past is not something to regret. It is who you are, and there is little that is more self-destructive than regretting yourself.




However, we have been given the present for the purpose of making the future something different than the past. The only way to change the past is to add positive experiences and choices to it. How do we do that? By utilizing the present to do and be what we want to be in the future.




So what am I trying to say? There is no such thing as a fresh start or a do-over! All you can do is freshen your resolve and do better. Don’t try to replace the past, just improve the present.
