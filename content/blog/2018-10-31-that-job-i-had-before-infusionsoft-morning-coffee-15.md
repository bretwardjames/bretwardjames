In this episode of Morning Coffee, I tell the story of my first real job (pre-Infusionsoft).  

My little brother, Craig, and I, worked for a guy making copies of antlers.  

Yep, you read that right - antlers.  

As in deer antlers.  

Lots of fun anecdotes in the story (definitely you should check it out), but there was one thing I mentioned that I want to call out.  

When I left working for that guy to go start work at Infusionsoft, I didn't know that it was polite to give 2 weeks notice.  

And so I didn't.  

Obviously, if it came down to a choice between giving two weeks and working at Infusionsoft, I'd make the same decision again.  

But that wasn't the case.  

I just didn't understand the way things worked, and I wasn't very good at empathy.  

Now, it's not like this guy's business went under because of me leaving. It's not like anyone died or anything. In fact, given all the context, I don't think most people would think I did anything wrong.  

Regardless, it was a selfish, dick move, and I regret it to this day. I wish I'd given him the two weeks.  

The point is, "looking out for number 1" isn't always the best way to approach things.
