It's crazy to realize how much my early days at Infusionsoft have influenced the rest of my life.

When I started, there were 7 of us:

4 Brothers (Scott, Eric, Brad, and me)

1 In-Law (Clate)

1 Neighbor (Tara)

and Jeremy

I don't believe Jeremy was related in any way, but he might as well have been. 

I always knew that Infusionsoft started as a "family" business, but I didn't appreciate how true that was until this morning.

A lot happened back then, but as I look back, there are two extremely important lessons from the first few months working there that have stuck with me all the way until now.

And they kind of define me in some ways.

The first is a lesson from Brad, and it's broken into two parts:

1. How you format emails to customers matters just as much as what you say in them.

I don't know if Brad was consciously creating a system back then, or if it was just instinctual, but we had a very specific format for how emails were formatted.

Spaces between paragraphs, not too much wording, short, to the point.

I can still type "Let me know if you have any other questions" with my eyes closed because of the muscle memory I developed then.

2. If you exchange more than 2 emails with a customer, call them. 

It's very easy to use email as a way of putting off the real work, which is digging in with the customer and fixing the problem. The phone takes away your hiding place.

It didn't matter back then if it LOOKED like we were on top of things with our customers - all that mattered is if we were actually solving their problems.

The second lesson came from Eric. 

I am almost certain that he wasn't trying to teach me anything, but regardless, he did.

Eric never let me get away with asking a question poorly. If I didn't have enough information or didn't phrase the question in a way that made it easy for him to answer, I was sent back to get the proper info.

I got really good at translating what the customer was saying into speak that Eric could work with.

And because Eric and I worked about 5 feet from each other, I had to get good at doing that really fast.

That ability to act as a translator between people that are frankly speaking different languages has helped me immensely in my career. 

Not only that, I have become extremely good at getting what I need from people that I've never met before because I understand how important the context of the question is.

The way you get answers is by making it easy for the other person to answer.

I will forever be grateful for that time in the early days and what it taught me.

And the crazy part is - this is just from the first couple of months! There is SO MUCH MORE that I learned from the rest of my experiences.
