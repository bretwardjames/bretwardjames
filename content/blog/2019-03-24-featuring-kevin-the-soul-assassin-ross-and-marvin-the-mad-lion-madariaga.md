Absolute legends in their own right, Kevin and Marvin, stop by to chat a bit about fighting and some of the differences 
between the old school fight mentality and the struggle of a fighter coming up now. 

As per the usual, Wick the Bear makes a cameo appearance and I do my best to stay quiet and let them talk, although I 
don't do a GREAT job of that, but we have some good conversation.

Enjoy.
