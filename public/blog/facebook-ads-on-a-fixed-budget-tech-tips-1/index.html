<p>If you’re running Facebook ads, you probably don’t have an unlimited budget. (side note - if you do have an unlimited budget, my hat goes off to you. also, you should give me some)</p>

<p>The problem with being on a limited budget is keeping track of how much you’re spending across the various campaigns that you’re running, not to mention the posts that you’re boosting.</p>

<p>However, there’s a little hack you can use to make sure that no matter what you do, your monthly ad spend will always be the same.</p>

<p>Here’s how you do it:</p>

<h2 id="1-consolidate-your-campaigns"><strong>1. Consolidate Your Campaigns</strong></h2>

<p><br />
The first thing you need to do is create 3-5 campaigns, organized by preferred outcome.</p>

<p>You may end up with more or less campaigns depending on whether you release video content. You’ll want to have a campaign for each type of content. So if you have videos, you’ll want a campaign optimized for video views. If you have blog content, you’ll want a campaign optimized for content views (viewContent). If you have content that is intended to get someone to take some action outside Facebook, you’ll want a campaign optimized for conversions. So, assuming you release videos on a regular basis, these are the campaigns you’d have:</p>

<p>Awareness (optimized for brand awareness)</p>

<p>Video Engagement (optimized for video views)</p>

<p>Content Engagement (optimized for viewContent)</p>

<p>Action (optimized for conversions)
</p>

<h2 id="2-campaign-budget-optimization"><strong>2. Campaign Budget Optimization</strong></h2>

<p><br />
The next thing you need to do is set all of your campaigns to optimize the spend at the campaign level:</p>

<p><img src="/images/blog/campaign-budget.png" alt="Campaign Budget" /></p>

<p>You can set each campaign to a limited budget of as low as $2/day (around $65/mo). That would total out to $8/day across all 4 of the campaigns (or $260/mo).</p>

<h2 id="3-configure-the-campaigns-for-cold-and-warm-audience-targeting"><strong>3. Configure the Campaigns for Cold and Warm Audience Targeting</strong></h2>

<p><br />
Within each of the above campaigns, set up ad sets to distinguish between target groups. I normally have 3 ad sets per campaign:</p>

<p><img src="/images/blog/audience-rollups.png" alt="Audience Rollups" /></p>

<p>Warm audience rollup - basically anyone that has engaged in any way (watched video, clicked to website, liked/commented/shared post, etc)</p>

<p>Cold lookalike rollup - all of your lookalike audiences combined.</p>

<p>Cold interest rollup - targeting based on interest only (no custom audiences).</p>

<p>I also like to make the audiences mutually exclusive, so I’ll exclude my lookalike audiences from the Warm and Interest rollups, the Warm Audience from the Cold Rollups, etc.</p>

<p>And now for the secret sauce.</p>

<h2 id="4-add-new-content-to-existing-campaigns"><strong>4. Add New Content To Existing Campaigns</strong></h2>

<p><br />
 Now, when you release new content, instead of boosting the post individually, simply add it to the existing campaign based on the type of content and who should see it.</p>

<p>So if you release a new video intended for your followers, here’s what you do:</p>

<p><img src="/images/blog/campaign-setup.png" alt="Campaign Setup" /></p>

<p>Navigate to the Video Engagement campaign</p>

<p>Select the Warm Audience Rollup ad set</p>

<p>Click “Create” to create a new ad</p>

<p>Select “Use Existing Post”</p>

<p>Select your post</p>

<p>Publish</p>

<p>The really cool thing is that it doesn’t matter where the post was originally released (Facebook/Instagram), because it can be promoted on both platforms at the same time (assuming the video isn’t longer than 1 minute).</p>

<p>The wrap-up
Setting up your campaigns this way will help you organize your content by use, but more importantly it helps you keep your ad spend predictable. Instead of creating a new campaign for every post, you’re simply using the campaigns that already exist, and adding the content to those.</p>

<p>On a regular basis, it’s a good idea to go back through and disable the content that isn’t performing as well, so that you can make way for fresh content.</p>
