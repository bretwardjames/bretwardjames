	<p>I think sometimes you just need to be ok with things not working out before you can really appreciate when they do.</p>

<p>People are always telling me that I should plan for the worst, that way when things do work out it will be that much more exciting. I always thought that was a little too pessimistic and depressing for me, so I never did it. I&rsquo;ve always sort of expected the best things to happen, and when they don&rsquo;t, I usually just push back until they at least kind of work out the way I wanted. I guess I&rsquo;ve always just wanted things to go they way I want (oh the ironic redundancy of that statement), and I&rsquo;ve never been ok with anything else.</p>

<p>I think I&rsquo;m finally starting to figure it out, however.</p>

<p>This internship has been on my mind for a couple of months now. When I went to that meeting (again, mostly for the donuts), I didn&rsquo;t think I would be as excited about it or want to do it as badly as I discovered that I do. However, I&rsquo;m not in a position to put down $20,000 (which is what it would have realistically cost) for that kind of experience. I simply can&rsquo;t afford it. I spent a while coming to grips with the fact that the Moscow gig wasn&rsquo;t going to happen for me, and I should let it go. Once I finally let it go, it wasn&rsquo;t three days but I get a call saying I could go for free (essentially).That was super exciting. I was so sure that it was a slam dunk deal and I&rsquo;d definitely get to go. However, there were questions. I had to figure out whether I would still be able to graduate in December and whether or not I would be able to complete the one remaining religion credit that I would need to graduate at all. I had to make sure that the university would let me change my second major to a minor, and I had to figure out, ifÂ I could take an independent study course for the religion requirement, how I would handle the proctored exams, because I would be a long way from any authorized university testing centers.</p>

<p>Some of these questions were depressing. First, the university has a policy that you have to go through a petition process to change your major after you have 90 credits (I have 95). Second, the deadline for counting an independent study course for Spring/Summer is in the middle of July, and we wouldn&rsquo;t get back from Moscow until the middle of August. Third, what happens if I can&rsquo;t get my job back when I return? These were all serious roadblocks, and I was a little upset that so many roadblocks would immediately present themselves. To me, it seemed like revelation, and there shouldn&rsquo;t be any difficulty. And yet, there they were, not going anywhere. Annoying little buggers.</p>

<p>I spent a few hours fuming over all of these questions, and especially over the fact that it was a three-day weekend, and I wouldn&rsquo;t be able to get most of those questions answered until Tuesday morning (this morning). So I just had to sit and stew all weekend, trying to enjoy the break, but not really being able to because I had this looming over my head. Then something clicked inside me.</p>

<p>I remembered how I felt when Dr. Brown called and offered me the position. I remember how good it felt to find out that someone else was thinking of me like that, and that I was important to someone, and not just any someone either. These are tenured professors at a university who were thinking of me. It meant the world to me. Once I realized that it was possible that the only reason that I had been offered the position was so that I would feel important to someone, I instantly calmed down and was ok with all of the questions. Hence the follow-up post (The very next day).I spent the rest of the weekend very relaxed and happy. I was actually ok with not going, because I knew that even if I couldn&rsquo;t go, I had still received something priceless from just being offered the position. It was nice.</p>

<p>Moral of the story:</p>

<p>Sometimes you need to be ok with the worst possible outcome. It&rsquo;s ok to just cut your losses and appreciate what you&rsquo;ve already got. You definitely appreciate when things go right if you&rsquo;re already expecting them to go wrong. Plus, if you don&rsquo;t expect things to go right, then you spend more time trying to make them go right, and you find other things that would have gone wrong otherwise. So be pessimistic, but be positive in your pessimism. Plan for the worst, expect the worst, and work accordingly. The important thing is to be ok with whatever happens, and not get too worked up over things. Life is going to throw you curveballs, and you may not always hit them, but at least you&rsquo;re on a team, right?</p>

<p>PS Most of those issues worked themselves out in a matter of 30 minutes this morning. The university&rsquo;s policy on major changes after 90 credits only applies to your primary major, and the religion department allows you to take 5 credits if you&rsquo;re taking Survey of World Religions (the only 3-credit religion class) and another class (in my case, D&amp;C). My boss is more than willing to take me back after the summer, and I even got a lead on a job for after I graduate.</p>

<p>Sometimes you just have to be ok with things not working out. Then when they do work out, it&rsquo;s like Christmas morning :)</p>
