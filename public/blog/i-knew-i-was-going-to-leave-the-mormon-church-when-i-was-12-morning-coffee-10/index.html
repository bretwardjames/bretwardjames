	<p>I am usually the first to disregard my own instincts.</p>

<p>I love making calculated decisions based on data and analysis.</p>

<p>In fact, my default setting is pretty much always set to &ldquo;question everything always&rdquo;.  It&rsquo;s especially true of my own thoughts.</p>

<p>But I think maybe I lean too far in that direction.  I&rsquo;ve made plenty of decisions in my life that it took me several years to finally put into action. I&rsquo;m always second-guessing myself.</p>

<p>The potential fallout from taking a hardline stance on something and ending up on the wrong side of it has kept me in limbo way too often (and for way too long).</p>

<p>I think the reality is that I know the difference between a passing thought that needs to be scrutinized and molded into a mature thought and an instinct that I need to act on.</p>

<p>Maybe it&rsquo;s better to be wrong sometimes and be true to yourself than it is to be &ldquo;right&rdquo; and waste time on the hemming and the hawing.</p>

<p>I can say that I&rsquo;m trusting my instincts more these days. And so far I&rsquo;m not dead.</p>

<p>So there&rsquo;s that.</p>
