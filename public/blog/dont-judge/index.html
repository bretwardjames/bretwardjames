	<p>You&rsquo;re not qualified, and even if you were, someone else already got the job</p>

<p>Stephen Covey wrote a book about habits that effective people have. In that book, he talks a lot about paradigm and compares a person&rsquo;s paradigm to a pair of colored glasses. He makes the point that the world looks a little bit different to a person with yellow lenses than it does to someone with red lenses. The first might look at an object and see that it&rsquo;s green, while the other sees purple. His point was directed in a little different direction than mine is, so I&rsquo;ll just leave the analogy at that and pick up with my part.</p>

<p>Too often in life we get stuck behind our personalized, colored paradigm goggles. Our entire lives have been spent crafting these spectacles of perspective, and everything that we were ever taught or experienced is melded into the workings. We were raised a certain way, so our lenses have a certain thickness. We had our heart broken and so the frames are a little bent in places. We took time to smell the roses one morning and installed bifocal lenses, and so on and so forth. Each of us sees the world and situations differently because of where we come from and those glasses that we&rsquo;ve made for ourselves. The point I will attempt to make is that no matter how long and hard those two people with the yellow and red lenses argue about it, they&rsquo;ll never realize that the thing they&rsquo;re looking at is actually blue, not green or purple. Sometimes you have to take off the glasses and see what&rsquo;s actually there, not just what seems to be there.</p>

<p>The French Impressionistic painters, including Claude Monet and Eduoard Manet, took a huge leap from the traditional art form when they started making their works of art. For so long, art had been focused on technical skill and exactness, and they saw the need to breathe new life into art in a way that had never been done before. Before the Impressionists, art was about representing actuality to the last detail. They point was to recreate reality on the canvas. The Impressionists didn&rsquo;t follow that form. They were all about painting what they were seeing, and not worrying about what it actually was. It didn&rsquo;t matter if the boat tied up to the dock didn&rsquo;t look exactly like a boat tied up to the dock, because to the Impressionist, it didn&rsquo;t look like a boat at the moment the painting was being done. Impressionistic painting is beautiful and inspiring, and frankly genius, but the moment we find ourselves in on of those paintings, so to speak, we&rsquo;ll run into problems. Reality and art are two very different things. The whole point of art has always been an attempt to recreate reality in an unreal situation. Paintings take moments of time and freeze them forever, but it is just an interpretation of a moment in time, not the moment itself. Songs try to capture human emotion and evoke it in others, but it still hasn&rsquo;t quite been mastered. Books and poetry try to use words to describe the indescribable. The point is everyone needs to see the line between perception and reality.</p>

<p>Now, there are those of a philosophical mind that would argue that reality is what we perceive it to be. To that argument I respond as follows:</p>

<p>Many have, hoping to take on a certain air of philosophical genius, asked the following question. If a tree falls in the forest and nobody hears it, does it make a sound? Too often debates ensue for hours at a time about whether sound exists only because there are ears to hear it, and therefore in the absence of ears, there is no such thing as sound, and the physics of sound being a universal law. The answer, of course, can never be fully realized, because people are too stuck in their definitions of &ldquo;sound&rdquo;. It&rsquo;s the same as asking me to tell you what color this chair is if I&rsquo;m wearing yellow glasses and you&rsquo;re wearing red glasses. I&rsquo;m always going to say that the chair is green, and you are always going to reject my opinion for the obvious reason that you see a purple chair. The only real way to answer the question is to take off the glasses and look at the chair.</p>

<p>There are certain concepts in particular that I want to address specifically here. The first, and most important to me, is the concept of God. I use the term &ldquo;concept&rdquo; here very warily, as it doesn&rsquo;t convey my beliefs accurately. God has been the most debated idea or concept in the history of this earth. More wars have been fought over God than over anything else. There are still wars going on over God. Creeds have been created, churches have been set up, opposition has appeared, and the question still remains, is there a God? I will attempt to answer this question.</p>

<p>In the universe, outside of man&rsquo;s ability to control or fathom, there are distinct Truths. These Truths are the actualities of reality. There are countless numbers of these Truths, and sometimes we don&rsquo;t recognize them. For example, the earth revolves around the sun. For eons, people were so sure that the sun went around the earth, and there were many who were killed for supposing otherwise. This was also true about the earth being round. Yet, the earth is indeed round, and it does indeed revolve around the sun. These Truths are absolute and cannot be altered by any means that we have at our disposal. No amount of talking or rationalizing can change these universal facts. No matter what glasses you hide behind to say otherwise, the round earth is in actuality revolving around the sun. It is so.</p>

<p>With that same idea in mind, that there are certain Truths in the universe that reside separate in their own sphere of existence, influencing this one in which we live, but unable to be influenced by this one in which we live, we will pose the question again. Is there a God? The answer is either yes or no. There is no third option in this equation. There either is a God or there isn&rsquo;t. From these two answers spring other questions. Assuming the answer to the initial question is yes, that there is a God, questions arise like, &ldquo;What is God?&rdquo;, &ldquo;Is there a correct religion?&rdquo;, and the ever-present, &ldquo;Why does God allow so much evil into the world?&rdquo;. From these questions come other questions and the tree of questions continues to grow and grow. Those questions, however, have either immense weight and meaning, or no meaning at all. If there is no God, there is no reason to ask why God allows bad things to happen. If there is a God, however, it is very important to know what God is and how It would be worshipped, if at all (is there a correct religion?). This tree of questions that arise or don&rsquo;t arise depending on the answer to the previous question points directly to the utter importance of the first question as a basis for all other questions on the matter. One cannot make conclusions about the answers to any of these questions in reverse order. The answer to the question, why does God allow evil in the world, does not answer the question of whether or not there is a God. One must first take off the glasses that cloud the ability to see the answer for what it is. That there is evil in the world also does not answer the question of whether there is a God. One must first find the answer to that initial question before embarking on any quests for answers to the later questions. Those will be answered by default as the first question is answered. But that first question must be answered, based on Truth, or the actuality of reality. One cannot simply decide that there is or isn&rsquo;t a God. One must find out the Truth. To avoid preaching, I will end there.</p>

<p>Another of the concepts that has been debated for centuries was alluded to in the previous paragraph. It is the concept of a correct religion. As was mentioned before, there are questions that need be answered even before this one is considered, but assuming that those questions have been answered in a manner that brings this question into importance, the answer is again, either yes or no. Just as with the existence of God, either there is a correct religion or there isn&rsquo;t. If there is, there are countless questions that follow, and if there isn&rsquo;t, life becomes quite simple and complex simultaneously.</p>

<p>There are many more of these concepts that arise in everyday life, and to avoid attempting to exhaust that list here, I will conclude this line of reasoning with this comment. Asking the question, is there a God, requires at the basest level that the asker be willing to accept the answer for what it is, and not for what it seems to be. There is implication that those paradigm goggles be removed and the Truth be seen for what it really is, for Truth is something that can only be seen, not altered or stinted. Truth is how things actually are.</p>

<p>The point is that too often we are caught up in what the world and our surroundings have taught us is real, and we forget to see the world as it really is. Truth is a beautiful thing; one need simply remove the spectacles of perspective and see it for the actuality of reality that it is.</p>
