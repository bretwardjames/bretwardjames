	<p>It&rsquo;s crazy to realize how much my early days at Infusionsoft have influenced the rest of my life.</p>

<p>When I started, there were 7 of us:</p>

<p>4 Brothers (Scott, Eric, Brad, and me)</p>

<p>1 In-Law (Clate)</p>

<p>1 Neighbor (Tara)</p>

<p>and Jeremy</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t believe Jeremy was related in any way, but he might as well have been.</p>

<p>I always knew that Infusionsoft started as a &ldquo;family&rdquo; business, but I didn&rsquo;t appreciate how true that was until this morning.</p>

<p>A lot happened back then, but as I look back, there are two extremely important lessons from the first few months working there that have stuck with me all the way until now.</p>

<p>And they kind of define me in some ways.</p>

<p>The first is a lesson from Brad, and it&rsquo;s broken into two parts:</p>

<ol>
<li>How you format emails to customers matters just as much as what you say in them.</li>
</ol>

<p>I don&rsquo;t know if Brad was consciously creating a system back then, or if it was just instinctual, but we had a very specific format for how emails were formatted.</p>

<p>Spaces between paragraphs, not too much wording, short, to the point.</p>

<p>I can still type &ldquo;Let me know if you have any other questions&rdquo; with my eyes closed because of the muscle memory I developed then.</p>

<ol>
<li>If you exchange more than 2 emails with a customer, call them.</li>
</ol>

<p>It&rsquo;s very easy to use email as a way of putting off the real work, which is digging in with the customer and fixing the problem. The phone takes away your hiding place.</p>

<p>It didn&rsquo;t matter back then if it LOOKED like we were on top of things with our customers - all that mattered is if we were actually solving their problems.</p>

<p>The second lesson came from Eric.</p>

<p>I am almost certain that he wasn&rsquo;t trying to teach me anything, but regardless, he did.</p>

<p>Eric never let me get away with asking a question poorly. If I didn&rsquo;t have enough information or didn&rsquo;t phrase the question in a way that made it easy for him to answer, I was sent back to get the proper info.</p>

<p>I got really good at translating what the customer was saying into speak that Eric could work with.</p>

<p>And because Eric and I worked about 5 feet from each other, I had to get good at doing that really fast.</p>

<p>That ability to act as a translator between people that are frankly speaking different languages has helped me immensely in my career.</p>

<p>Not only that, I have become extremely good at getting what I need from people that I&rsquo;ve never met before because I understand how important the context of the question is.</p>

<p>The way you get answers is by making it easy for the other person to answer.</p>

<p>I will forever be grateful for that time in the early days and what it taught me.</p>

<p>And the crazy part is - this is just from the first couple of months! There is SO MUCH MORE that I learned from the rest of my experiences.</p>
