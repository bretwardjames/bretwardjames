	<p><strong>Introduction</strong></p>

<p>There is great confusion in the Latter-day Saint community surrounding and dealing with the issue of homosexuality and same-sex marriage. We have been instructed by our leaders that homosexuality is wrong and that we should support any proposition in defending marriage as being between a man and a woman. When this instruction was first given, I had serious doubts and troubles justifying this to myself. I could not justify that with what I knew concerning the equal protection clause of the 14th Amendment. It wasn’t until I understood certain facts about truth and homosexuality that it became clear to me why this is the case.</p>

<p>I will not attempt simply to defend the church&rsquo;s stance on homosexuality and same-sex marriage in this paper. The legalization of homosexual marriage is an entirely separate topic which I will not try to defend or reject. That is a topic for another debate or paper at a different time. My purpose is instead to enlighten the reader as to why we believe and have been directed in this way and clear up the confusion surrounding the origin of homosexuality. I believe there are many who do not truly understand the facts about homosexuality. Many critics and even some church members falsely accuse the church of bigotry towards a growing population of homosexuals in our society. This is because of misunderstanding church members act and speak in an unauthorized representation of church policy and the actual doctrine. I hope to show that accusation of bigotry to be completely false by presenting the metaphysical relationship between the spirit and the body and how that plays a key role in the entire question of homosexuality, as well as help the reader to understand how we have been doctrinally directed to act and relate to homosexuals.</p>

<p><strong>A Question of Origin</strong></p>

<p>** **The first item to discuss is the very question of the origin of homosexuality. Many in the church claim that it is merely a choice, and that those who consider themselves homosexual simply decided that they want to live that lifestyle. As a rule, this argument lacks fundamental and basic knowledge of how the body works and the role that emotions play in the physical characteristics of a person. It is possible, however, that there are those who are simply attracted to the homosexual lifestyle who choose to take it up simply for that reason. To discount that possibility would be foolish; to consider it the general rule would be equally as foolish. There are others who believe that homosexuality is a result of a particular type of upbringing. It will be shown, however, that while upbringing can certainly influence a person&rsquo;s sexual preferences, this by itself is most likely not the sole cause or reason for a person&rsquo;s sexuality to be affected in such a drastic way. The opinion of the vast majority of proponents of homosexuality is stated succinctly in the phrase, &ldquo;I was born this way.&rdquo; I believe that the fact that this argument is used by so many pro-gay activists is the reason that many in the church disregard it as impossible. However, I will show that this is in fact a very likely cause of homosexuality. I will show that same-gender attraction is a real physical characteristic, and as such it should be given the respect deserved of it. I believe it important to note that I do not use the term &ldquo;cause&rdquo; when referring to homosexuality in the same context that one would refer to the &ldquo;cause&rdquo; of a crime, disaster, or disease. I do not wish to demean homosexuality in any way, and so I use &ldquo;cause&rdquo; to simply mean the origin of those feelings.</p>

<p><strong>Relationship between Spirit and Physical Body</strong></p>

<p>In order to further discuss this question, we must consider the fact that there is more to our physical makeup than we sometimes consider. In the church we are constantly reminded that our bodies house our spirits, and most of the focus of these discussions is on the spirit, and not the body. I will attempt to give each part of what constituted our physical, spiritual, and Intelligent makeup equal weight in the discussion of homosexuality.</p>

<p>There are three different parts of what we know as our bodies, two of which are less known and one of which is very seldom known or talked about. One of them is obvious, it is our physical body. This is the part of us that can feel the pain of a cut or a burn, or the tingle of a cold shower. Our eyes are what see the world around us and our ears are what hear it. Our body is the medium through which we interact with others and it is a tool that we use while here on this earth. Contrary to very popular belief, our body does not constitute &ldquo;us&rdquo;. Our body is merely the casing for the other parts.</p>

<p>The second part of us is our spirit. Our spirit bodies are much like our physical bodies, except that instead of being made of physical matter, they are made of spiritual matter. We don&rsquo;t know much about the physics of spirit matter, except that it has the ability to enter physical matter and control its actions. Our spirit bodies look just like our physical bodies, or rather; our physical bodies become what they become in large part because of our spirit bodies.</p>

<p>The third part, however, is what actually “us” is. It is called Intelligence, or Essence. Just as spiritual matter inhabits and controls physical matter, Intelligence is housed in spiritual matter, and is what controls the spirit, and therefore the body. The brain is like the cockpit to our body. Without it, we can&rsquo;t control our body, but the cockpit doesn&rsquo;t control the plane without a pilot. Our minds are not the result of firings of neurons and brain function, although our brains are vital to the controlling of our body. What is &ldquo;us&rdquo; therefore, is a part of us that is neither physical nor spiritual. That is how we can still be us after we die, and how people are able to have out-of-body experiences and realize that they are having them. Our brain does not house us, for we are made of much higher stuff. For purposes of this paper, I will refer to the spirit and Intelligence together, as “spirit”.</p>

<p><strong>Homosexuality as a Physical Characteristic</strong></p>

<p>Given the distinction between the physical and the spiritual, it is necessary to discuss which human traits originate in the spiritual and which originate in the physical. It is important to recognize that while the spirit has control over the body and its actions, the body still influences the spirit in many ways. This creates a conglomeration of spiritual and physical characteristics that make up each person&rsquo;s individual being. For example, gender originates in the spirit. Our physical gender is a direct result of the influencing power of our spirits in the development of our bodies. Also, identity originates in the spirit. Who we are is not a result of where we were born or how we were raised. Instead we have a pre-mortal identity that transcends time and space. In general, characteristics that would apply on a spiritual level originate there, whereas things that do not apply on the spiritual level originate in the physical. A prime example of this is our preferences regarding food. Physical nourishment is something that is purely that, physical. When we eat food, it is not our spirits but our bodies that even realize that it is occurring. Therefore, which foods we prefer is a matter that comes from our body&rsquo;s physical responses to the types of foods we eat. So, the preference of chocolate to vanilla ice cream is a result of a person&rsquo;s physical makeup, and has little to do with, and is virtually un-influenced by, the spirit. These are the characteristics about which we say, &ldquo;I was born that way,&rdquo; or, &ldquo;That&rsquo;s how my mother raised me.&rdquo; To enumerate more examples, fashion sense, hairstyle preference, sport of choice, climate preference and musical taste are primarily physical characteristics. Along with these <em>preferences</em>, and most other preferences relating to the world we live in, is the sexual preference of members of the same gender – homosexuality.</p>

<p>Although it is much deeper rooted and much more difficult to reverse, same-gender attraction is basically the same as preference of chocolate to vanilla ice cream or a preference of vegetarianism. To illustrate, I have loved ice cream since I was a child, and that love is most likely a result of my dad and older brothers always eating it. So my love for ice cream was a learned or acquired preference. However, my preference of vanilla to chocolate in most cases is a result of the taste centers in my brain requiring a specific message from my taste buds in order for the endorphins to be released to give me the physically pleasing sensation involved in eating vanilla ice cream. I have since trained my brain to accept chocolate ice cream as well, but it is still does not quite produce the same effect. In this same way, there are those whose brains release those pleasure chemicals in response to a specific message from the sensory organs indicating another of their same sex. In the same way that my brain releases the correct pleasures when I eat vanilla ice cream as opposed to chocolate, some brains are pleased with associating romantically and intimately with members of the same sex.</p>

<p>At this point I will address some important things that may seem to contradict my arguments. Current accepted psychological authorities attribute homosexuality to the human psyche and consider it a psychological preference, not a physical preference. The American Psychiatric Association (APA) has stated &ldquo;some people believe that sexual orientation is innate and fixed; however, sexual orientation develops across a person’s lifetime&rdquo;. Also, a report from the Centre for Addiction and Mental Health states: &ldquo;For some people, sexual orientation is continuous and fixed throughout their lives. For others, sexual orientation may be fluid and change over time&rdquo;. The APA has also said, “most people experience little or no sense of choice about their sexual orientation,&rdquo; and in a joint statement with other major American medical organizations, the APA has stated, &ldquo;different people realize at different points in their lives that they are heterosexual, gay, lesbian, or bisexual&rdquo;. This assessment of homosexuality is valid based on current understanding of the human mind. For the psychological world, the mind is centered in the brain, and is a part of the physical body. The reason for this is a lack of understanding of the true nature of the body, particularly the mind. Therefore, this understanding of homosexuality is only valid when the spirit, body, and intelligence are considered together as one entity. Due to the fact that most psychological organizations today do consider them together as one entity, they are correct in their assumptions, but in light of a deeper understanding of the relationship between spirit and body which I have presented, that assumption is not universally valid. To gain a deeper and more correct understanding of the actuality of the situation, one must take into consideration the difference between the brain (body), and the spirit (and intelligence). The idea that science has yet to fully realize the deeper truth about a subject is not new. For centuries, scientists have discovered deeper truths about everything from molecular structure to evolutionary biology. What begins as a general understanding that can be applicable most of the time becomes a more specific rule or law that has applicability in almost all cases. As understanding becomes more specific, the rules and laws are applied with correct specificity, and there are less and less exceptions to the laws and rules. In a later section of this paper, I will deal more with this idea, and that section should help to clear up any confusion.</p>

<p><strong>Acting on Homosexual Feelings: Spirit vs. Body</strong></p>

<p>Inherent in the differences between the spiritual and the physical is the realization of the origin of the force of will. Given that the body is controlled by the spirit and Intelligence, it follows that Intelligence and spirit direct the actions of the body. As was stated earlier, I will refer to Intelligence and spirit together simply as spirit.</p>

<p>For this section of the paper, I will refer to thought directed action and instinct directed action. To clarify, thought directed action is action that originates from logic or reasoning and defies the instinctive action, which is based mainly on natural, carnal instinct, not on thought or logical reasoning. Thought directed instinct originates from Intelligence, while instinct directed action originates in the body.</p>

<p>Thought directed action by definition is in direct competition with natural instinct. It is the natural, physical instinct of a person to avoid pain at all costs, and flee when harmed. However, bodybuilders continue to fight through the pain, Special Forces operatives train to withstand torture, and people everywhere sit quietly through uncomfortable dentist appointments. This principle is better known as the &ldquo;mind over matter&rdquo; principle, and many people have come to realize that what a person&rsquo;s body tells them to do does not necessarily have to be what they choose to do. This is because thought occurs in the spirit by way of Intelligence and not the brain or body itself. Even when the body is telling the spirit that it needs or wants something, the spirit has the freedom and the power to decide whether it will obey the body&rsquo;s request.</p>

<p>Instinct directed action comes from the opposite side. Instinct is the physical body&rsquo;s natural reaction to various stimuli, and in most instances these reactions are centered around avoiding pain or gaining pleasure. Succumbing fully to instinct usually results in very primal, animal-like behavior.</p>

<p>It is important to reiterate the fact that even when instinct is very strongly suggesting a certain action, the spirit always has the choice to obey or not to obey. When I burn my hand on the stove, instinct tells me to instantly remove my hand and run it under cold water, but my spirit still has the power to choose whether or not to move it. Pain is a physical reaction between the hot stove and my now melting skin that sends an urgent message to the brain to quite clearly point out that something very harmful is occurring. This does not require a response, however, because the spirit still has the power to override the instinctual response. Another good indication of this is the chilling phenomenon when evil spirits possess a body. The Bible has many documented instances of such “possession” and in each case, the person was unable to make his/her own decisions because the evil spirits had taken control of the body. This simply supports the principle that there is power given to spiritual beings to inhabit and control physical bodies, and that the spiritual being has an inherent power over the actual physical body. &ldquo;Mind over matter&rdquo; simply means &ldquo;spirit controls body&rdquo;.</p>

<p>This principle is applied in the case of homosexuality in the same way it applies to the examples given. Regardless of the strength of the physical, homosexual feelings, the spirit has the power to choose to act or not to act on those feelings. Our spirits were given dominion over the flesh precisely for this reason. There are many elements of the physical experience that we are to overcome while here in the flesh. For some, it is a struggle with drugs or alcohol, for others, pornography. For many, the struggle is with an attraction to members of the same gender. Again, it is important to reiterate that these homosexual attractions originate in the body, not the spirit, and the spirit does have the power given to it to make decisions contrary to the physical nature of the body it governs. However, of all the struggles to be allotted to a person, I would suggest that a physical, sexual attraction to members of the same sex would be among the most difficult to deal with. This does not excuse acting on those feelings in a way contrary to the laws of God, but it does give members of the church a better idea of why they should not judge these people.</p>

<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>

<p>** **The information presented has shown homosexuality to be more than just a psychological or mental characteristic, but as an actual physical characteristic that influences a person’s desires and actions. Not taking into consideration the laws regarding adultery that have been set in place since the beginning of time, it is very important for all people, and especially those who believe homosexual action to be wrong, to understand and respect the reality of homosexuality. The law in place specifically forbids homosexual conduct of any kind, but there are equally important laws requiring men and women to love their neighbors and not judge others, to which every person is equally subjected. This means that members of the church should not only not hate or judge homosexuals, but should respect them and their particular situation and the difficulty thereof. At the same time, the information that has been presented here rejects any claim of general bigotry on the part of the church and its members based only on the position of the church on this particular issue. The church is completely justified in opposing homosexuality, and therefore same-sex marriage, even without considering secular or legal reasoning, based simply on certain truths that have been presented regarding the body and the spirit and how that information relates the eternal laws regarding human sexuality.</p>
