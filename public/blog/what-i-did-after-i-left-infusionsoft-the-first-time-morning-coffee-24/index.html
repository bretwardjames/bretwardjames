	<p>A lot of people say you should make your goals public. I think the idea is that you feel more accountable when someone else knows what you’re trying to do.</p>

<p>Personally, I don’t like doing this any more. I used to share my grand plans and huge goals, but recently I’ve shifted to letting my actions tell people about my goals.</p>

<p>You have to be careful with goals - sometimes saying your goal out loud can trick your brain into taking credit for the goal before you’ve even gotten started. It’s such an emotional release to verbalize your vision, sometimes it can kill the drive and motivation to actually go and achieve it.</p>

<p>Now, only when a goal is mostly achieved do I feel worthy of saying that it is a goal.</p>

<p>I tell myself that only when I accomplish my grand vision can I let people will know about it. I have found that it is a better way to achieve my goals AND harness that boost you get from sharing your vision with others.</p>

<p>And it’s kind of uncomfortable! I hate being misunderstood, and when people don’t really get what I’m trying to do, I want to lay out the whole plan so they completely understand how BRILLIANT I am.</p>

<p>But the truth is, I’m not brilliant until I pull it off.</p>

<p>I can explain how I’m going to do this and that and get these results and all this, but until I actually DO it, it doesn’t mean anything.</p>

<p>It doesn’t matter what you PLAN to do.</p>

<p>It matters what you’ve DONE.</p>
