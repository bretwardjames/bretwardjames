	<p>I have a little catching up to do on my writing here, so these next few posts might come rapid-fire. I would apologize, but close to nobody reads this anyway so what difference does it make, right?
One thing I’ve thought a lot about over the years is the concept of writing in pen versus writing in pencil. Let me explain. No, there is too much, let me sum up:</p>

<p>For a long time, I was of the opinion that it was better to write in pencil, because that way you can erase any mistakes that you make, and you don’t end up with a messy sheet of paper with scribbles and scratched-out mistakes. When you write in pencil, you have the ability, and the option, to get rid of any evidence that you wrote anything at all, and really gives you a back door to deny having had anything to do with whatever it was. So essentially you can either have a clean slate with nothing on the page, or at least you can have a neat-looking set of writings that is essentially your final draft.</p>

<p>I spent a lot of time thinking about how that can apply to real life. For example, instead of going all out with a particular idea, like a new business or project, and throwing all of your resources into one effort, it can be better to be cautious with how much you invest in one particular thing; if that particular project or business totally tanks, you can still pull out and “erase” the mistake, since you haven’t put too much of your effort and time into it. In other words, if you write lightly in pencil, and what you’re trying to write turns out to be totally worthless, you can just erase it, and nobody will be the wiser.</p>

<p>I thought a lot about that, and then realized how incredible boring and lifeless that philosophy is. There is no room for real improvement or growth with that ideology. If you spent your whole life walking around on eggshells so you can’t possible have a bad mark on your record, you’ll never have any good marks on it either. My new philosophy is as follows: Do everything you do on purpose, in other words, write in pen.</p>

<p>When I was a young piano student, one of the most often repeated pieces of advice from all of my teachers was to “make mistakes proudly,” meaning to not be timid about the parts of particular pieces that I wasn’t particularly sure of or confident in, and just play through it. When you make mistakes, but play so softly that you can’t really hear them, you will just keep playing the wrong notes and never fix them. You can avoid being told that you played wrong notes in practice or with your teacher, but the unfortunate thing is always that you will play the wrong notes in the performance. It’s much better to play wrong notes proudly in practice than to play wrong notes in the performance. That way you can learn from your mistakes and do better in the future.</p>

<p>I think it is very important to consciously decide our own actions and then take personal responsibility for the consequences of our actions. Instead of walking around and hoping that the wind will whisk us into the right path or whatever the idea may be, we should make conscious decisions to do things of our own free will. If you write in pen, to sum up the analogy, you won’t be able to erase your mistakes, but you will be able to really learn from them. Don’t timidly try things out. Just go out and do things on purpose. Do everything as though it was on purpose.</p>
