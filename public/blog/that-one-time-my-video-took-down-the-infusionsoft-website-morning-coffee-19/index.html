	<p>So there was this one time that I can back into the support office after getting a drink of water. We had a little dowel that we used to use in meetings as the &ldquo;Talking Stick&rdquo;.</p>

<p>I picked it up and started drumming on the chair and on my cup and on the desk and it turned out that Clint was recording the whole thing.</p>

<p>A couple of weeks later, I uploaded the video to what I thought was my own website, but turned out to be the main directory of the Infusionsoft website.</p>

<p>Short story shorter, the main website was entirely replaced with the video.</p>

<p>In retrospect, all things considered, it wasn&rsquo;t that big of a deal. Our website didn&rsquo;t get a ton of traffic at the time, and it has not had an adverse effect on the long-term growth and longevity of Infusionsoft as a company. But at the time, I am sure that it was not a pleasant situation.</p>

<p>Since then, I&rsquo;ve been involved in a lot of situations where something is displayed or sent that is incorrect. An email get sent with an improperly formatted subject line, a video is posted to a blog post that is incorrect, or a headline is misleading on a website.</p>

<p>But in every one of those situations, the immediate emotion made the situation seem much worse than it actually was. And time, as it always does, proved to everyone that what we thought mattered didn&rsquo;t.</p>

<p>I think as entrepreneurs we need to remember the mantra, &ldquo;Nobody cares&rdquo;, and apply it much more freely in our day-to-day lives.</p>

<p>Because the truth is, nobody cares.</p>
