I imagine most of you went straight to Google on that one (unless you already understand Russian, in which case I already congratulated you).
When I learned Russian, I was forced to go deeper than just the words they were using. Russians have an entirely different way of speaking. Everything from the way the sentences are structured to the inflection of the sentences.
If I tried to just replace English words with Russian words, but keep everything else the same, nobody would understand me.">

	<p>Если это понимаешь, молодец.</p>

<p>I imagine most of you went straight to Google on that one (unless you already understand Russian, in which case I already congratulated you).</p>

<p>When I learned Russian, I was forced to go deeper than just the words they were using. Russians have an entirely different way of speaking. Everything from the way the sentences are structured to the inflection of the sentences.</p>

<p>If I tried to just replace English words with Russian words, but keep everything else the same, nobody would understand me. And I know this, because the first 3 months in Ukraine, that was the case.</p>

<p>I would just think of what I wanted to say in English, and then translate as many of the words as I could into the Russian version, and then speak it.</p>

<p>But there is SO MUCH nuance in the way that Russians speak their language.</p>

<p>I learned very quickly (by listening intently) that you can’t just translate the words and expect people to understand.</p>

<p>I had to learn how to translate the entire concept.</p>

<p>For example - in English, we’d say:</p>

<p>“Would you like some coffee or tea?”</p>

<p>Here’s how you’d say that in Russian:</p>

<p>“Чай, кофе будешь?”</p>

<p>Literally, that translates to “Tea, coffee will you be?” (check it on Google, you’ll see).</p>

<p>And yet that is how they would say it.</p>

<p>And even if someone has lived and worked in Moscow for 20 years, they still won’t be able to speak as natively as someone who was born there.</p>

<p>There are subtle nuances that only a lifetime of speaking that language, without anything else to clutter the way you think or speak, would allow you know.</p>

<p>That’s why I’m so grateful to Infusionsoft for giving me so many chances in the early days, because automation was and is my first and only language in marketing and business.</p>

<p>Later, I’ll tell stories about how understanding the structure of  languages has helped me navigate some tense situations. But for now, I’m just grateful to have been given the opportunity that I was.</p>
