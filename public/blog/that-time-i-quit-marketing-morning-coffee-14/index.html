	<p>I have a sneaking suspicion (based only on my own experience) that most frustration is actually based in insecurity.</p>

<p>For example:</p>

<p>At the beginning of 2017, I quit the marketing game altogether.</p>

<p>I liked to say to myself that it was because I was fed up with the charlatanism and douchebagery that is so commonplace in the marketing world.</p>

<p>And that was kind of true.</p>

<p>Chicanery doth abound here.</p>

<p>However, the larger reason why I left was out of fear.</p>

<p>I had one major contract that was going away, and with it the bulk of my income.</p>

<p>I hadn&rsquo;t done any marketing for myself, didn&rsquo;t have any leads in the pipeline, and had an &ldquo;opportunity&rdquo; to go do something else.</p>

<p>I put opportunity in quotes because although I am incredibly grateful that I had that experience, I was really only using it as an excuse to not do the hard, grinding work of building my business up the right way.</p>

<p>Then, 5 months later, I made the same insecure decision again.</p>

<p>I was offered a job back in the marketing space, which seemed at the time to be a step up. Making way more money than I&rsquo;d ever made before, and in theory, only doing the things that I like doing.</p>

<p>I took the job, thinking that I was making a financial decision. Really, I was making a decision to avoid the grueling work that is necessary to make money as a kickboxing instructor.</p>

<p>And then finally I rounded out the trio of insecure decision making by leaving that job. I told myself it was because I was being required to do too much and it wasn&rsquo;t worth it, but really it was because I wasn&rsquo;t willing to do the hard work necessary to make the position fit.</p>

<p>All things considered, I don&rsquo;t regret any of those decisions, because I wouldn&rsquo;t be where I am today if I hadn&rsquo;t been through those situations and made those mistakes.</p>

<p>But now, as I embrace the grind, as I lean into the 12-hour days and everything that goes along with building a brand, I see how my insecurity had more to do with those decisions than anything else.</p>

<p>Not that the insecurity is gone, by the way. The difference is now I&rsquo;m hustling in spite of the insecurity, instead of trying to skirt around it.</p>
