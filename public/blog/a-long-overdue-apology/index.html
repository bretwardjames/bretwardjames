	<p>I want to take a break from my grandstanding and say something that I should have said a long time ago. Really, I should have realized that this needed to be said a long time ago, but I&rsquo;m stubborn and proud. I&rsquo;m working on that.</p>

<p>My therapist says I&rsquo;m an angry person. I think he&rsquo;s right. Everything that I do and everything that happens to me is tinted by an underlying layer of anger that I&rsquo;ve never fully understood (or tried to understand, for that matter). Tonight, I think I may have made a breakthrough discovery, and please don&rsquo;t take this as a pity party. There&rsquo;s a point here.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve spent the last couple of years dealing with a deep feeling of isolation. I feel isolated from people, disconnected from relationships. I haven&rsquo;t really felt important to anyone in a very long time. I find myself angrily &ldquo;advertising&rdquo; my blog posts on Facebook, absolutely pissed that people don&rsquo;t care enough about me to read on their own. I sometimes just sit and fume that I don&rsquo;t have people in my life that want to know how I feel, and how I&rsquo;m really doing, at least not people who are proactive about letting me know that they care. I don&rsquo;t want this to turn into a sob story, but the point is that I&rsquo;ve just felt like a means to an end, instead of an end unto itself. I feel like everyone should be treated like ends unto themselves.</p>

<p>Tonight, I made a startling discovery. That phrase, what goes around comes around, is absolutely true.</p>

<p>I started thinking tonight about why I feel the way I do. What is it about me that people want to stay away from, or that keeps people at armâ€™s length from me? Why am I fighting so hard with people to get them to notice me and appreciate me? Then it hit me.</p>

<p>I was an absolute jerk in high school, and even on my mission. Even after coming back from my mission I haven&rsquo;t really improved that much, although I do like to think that I&rsquo;ve improved some. But back then, nothing mattered but what I thought. I was the ultimate example of good and correct, and everyone else just didn&rsquo;t measure up. I&rsquo;m surprised that people would still talk to me after putting up with that for so long. Here&rsquo;s the kicker. I treated everyone as an means to and end, except for one person. I won&rsquo;t go into who or why; the point is I was a jerk to almost everyone. And here I am feeling sorry for myself because I&rsquo;m so isolated from everyone. What do I expect after treating people so terribly?</p>

<p>I hope that everyone I&rsquo;ve ever known reads this next part, because I feel like I&rsquo;ve taken advantage of just about everyone that I know.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m so sorry.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m sorry for everything. The holier-than-thou attitude that I had, the pride in my own infallibility, the using people for my own purposes, I&rsquo;m sorry for all of it. I&rsquo;m sorry for making you feel like dirt with things that I said. I&rsquo;m sorry for disregarding your feelings on my &ldquo;quest for spiritual perfection&rdquo;. I&rsquo;m sorry for &ldquo;never being wrong&rdquo;. I could go on forever. I&rsquo;m sorry to each and every one of you for everything that I&rsquo;ve done to you. I&rsquo;ve been a terrible friend to most of you, and worse to some of you.</p>

<p>I love you all for the fact that you didn&rsquo;t just leave me alone in high school, or ever for that matter. I am so grateful that you have enough patience with me to give me so many second chances. I can&rsquo;t tell you how terrible I feel each time I remember another instance when I took advantage of you or betrayed you. I&rsquo;m doing my penance now.</p>

<p>I just want you all to know that I&rsquo;m sorry for whatever I may have done to you in the past, and that I&rsquo;m now reaping the rewards of my actions. I honestly regret the way that I acted back then, and I&rsquo;m working hard to not continue in that way.</p>

<p>And I&rsquo;ll always be sorry.</p>
