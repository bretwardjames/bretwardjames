<h3 id="everybody-has-a-plan-until-they-get-punched-in-the-face">&ldquo;Everybody has a plan until they get punched in the face.&rdquo;</h3>

<p>That quote is commonly attributed to Mike Tyson, but I&rsquo;m pretty sure Mike&rsquo;s opponents understood this better than he ever did. Either way, I can personally verify that this is absolutely true.</p>

<p>Once that first bell rings, and the adrenaline hits you, all of your plans go right out the window. It&rsquo;s almost like you lose control of your brain.</p>

<p>In that moment, when it comes down to it, you do what you’ve trained yourself to do. It doesn’t matter what you <em>think</em> you’ve trained yourself to do - you will do what you’re trained to do.</p>

<p>I had three fights earlier this year, and in each of them I thought I was preparing for different things.</p>

<p>The first guy I knew was bigger than me, so I the plan was to move around, throw a lot of kicks, and rely on my cardio. But once that bell rang, all of those plans a schemes went out the window, and I defaulted to what I’d actually been training myself to do: clinch.</p>

<p>The second fight was against a shorter guy. The strategy (which I worked hard on the week of that fight) was to stay long, throw a lot of jabs and teeps, and pick him apart from the outside.</p>

<p>But again. Bell goes ding, and I revert back to clinch.</p>

<p>The third fight, I wanted to do more boxing. But again, once that bell rang, I defaulted back to what was comfortable: clinch.</p>

<p>I go back to what I know because for better or worse, I’ve trained myself to default back to clinching.</p>

<p>The punch line of all of this is that how you react when crisis hits is directly related to the _training _you&rsquo;ve put in beforehand.</p>

<p>You have to train, so that when the crisis hits, you can rely on your <em>instincts</em> to carry you until you can quiet your mind enough to solve the problems.</p>

<p>The worst thing you can do is pretend those days don&rsquo;t (or won&rsquo;t) exist. The people that get knocked out the worst are the ones that don&rsquo;t take their opponent seriously. Same is true for business. The more impervious you think you are to bad times, the more vulnerable you actually are.</p>

<p>The way to win is to prepare yourself.</p>

<p>Winners train for battle.</p>

<p>Losers don&rsquo;t even know the battle is coming.</p>

<p>What are you training yourself to do?</p>
