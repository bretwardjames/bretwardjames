	<p>Ok for this one, I have to go back in time a bit. All the way back to when I was a wee lad. We used to take a lot of trips to the lake back then and on one such occasion, some of the other boys and I decided to try cliff jumping.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Cliff&rdquo; is a bit of a misnomer. It was more like jumping off a small boulder.</p>

<pre><code>   [caption id=&quot;&quot; align=&quot;alignnone&quot; width=&quot;720.0&quot;]![ That's me on the left there, not long after the cliff jumping experience. ](http://static1.squarespace.com/static/5b29b282b27e39d3891a137e/5b29d50ac07b083624e43ad2/5b3102bd1ae6cf0724f9eaa6/1529872677975/14079709_10157305441640156_8293018239823024077_n.jpg)
</code></pre>

<p>That&rsquo;s me on the left there, not long after the cliff jumping experience. [/caption]</p>

<p>Any case, when it came to my turn, I stepped to the edge of the rock and as I looked down at the water realized that if I didn&rsquo;t jump <em>immediately</em>, then I wouldn&rsquo;t jump at all.</p>

<p>That moment (which, I&rsquo;m sure, lasted about half a second), was burned into my mind and I can still remember it vividly today.</p>

<p>Any time I find myself faced with a situation or task that scares me (which happens <em>all the time</em> ), I am immediately reminded of that moment, and I can say 100% that I have never regretted the times when I&rsquo;ve jumped. And at the same time, the times when I&rsquo;ve given in to the fear have always led to worse pain than the fear itself.</p>

<p>I wasn&rsquo;t afraid of Muay Thai at first. In the beginning, it was just an amazing workout with new friends that seemed more genuine than any I&rsquo;d had in a while. I am now fairly well aware that it might have been the <em>people</em> and not Muay Thai itself that gave that feeling of absolute acceptance, but regardless, I felt like I was finally part of a tribe.</p>

<p>But, as with anything, as you get better at something, more is required of you. And such was the case here - very quickly you graduate from hitting pads and mitts and kicking the bag into partner drills and sparring. Meaning you start getting punched.</p>

<p>And the better you get at not getting punched, the more you end up working with people with real experience, meaning when you do get punched, the higher the likelihood that it&rsquo;s going to really hurt.</p>

<p>And then there is the inevitable encouragement to take a fight. Almost like a rite of passage, it&rsquo;s something that everyone <em>should</em> do, and many people that train Muay Thai do it at least once, for the experience.</p>

<p>And like most things that require a lot of preparation and training, the feeling you get after you&rsquo;ve laid it all on the line is incomparable. Knowing that you prepared as best you could and you left everything in the ring is the most incredible feeling, even if you lose.</p>

<p>Make no mistake - it is terrifying, but that&rsquo;s how I know it&rsquo;s worth it. The fact that it terrifies me is what drives me to keep going.</p>

<pre><code>   [caption id=&quot;&quot; align=&quot;alignnone&quot; width=&quot;2500.0&quot;]![ There is nothing quite like this feeling. ](http://static1.squarespace.com/static/5b29b282b27e39d3891a137e/5b29d50ac07b083624e43ad2/5b3102bd1ae6cf0724f9eaa9/1529875890372/usko_0616-z.jpg)
</code></pre>

<p>There is nothing quite like this feeling. [/caption]</p>

<p>Funny thing is, though, the fear only lasts until the bell rings to start the first round. It builds and builds from the moment I take the fight all the way past weighing in and warming up and sealing the ring. That moment where I look across the ring at my opponent right before the ref tells us to fight is where it all peaks - everything hits me at once. What&rsquo;s going to happen? What if I get hurt? What if I let my coaches and teammates down? What if I choke?</p>

<p>And then that bell rings, and all of that is gone in an instant.</p>

<p>And for the next 8 minutes, there is nothing but me and him, and the calm violence that is Muay Thai.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve never been more afraid as the moments before a fight starts.</p>

<p>But I have never been more calm and at peace as when I am locked in a ring with another dude and we&rsquo;re trying to do as much physical harm to each other as possible.</p>

<p>Funny how that works, isn&rsquo;t it?</p>
