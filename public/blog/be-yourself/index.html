	<p>There&rsquo;s only one of you. We already have one of everyone else, and that&rsquo;s enough.</p>

<p>So often these days people are so convinced that they aren&rsquo;t good enough. We&rsquo;re all set on &ldquo;keeping up with the Jones&rsquo;s&rdquo; and making sure that we are &ldquo;in&rdquo; on the latest fads. We have to make it seem like we &ldquo;fit in&rdquo; so we try to act like those around us. There&rsquo;s always one &ldquo;leader&rdquo; of every group, and in order to fit in with that group, we have to emulate the leader. I think it’s ridiculous myself. The only thing that is accomplished is you end up with a group of the same person. How is that even enjoyable?</p>

<p>Another huge problem I see with this idea is all of the notions that are so widely accepted just because someone else said them. How often as children did the little boys have to say they didn&rsquo;t like boy bands because the other kids would make fun of them? Or how many teenagers have acted like they hated cats when they really didn&rsquo;t have anything against them. They act like they don&rsquo;t like a certain thing just to fit in with everyone. For me it was N&rsquo;Sync, the Backstreet Boys and country music. I have never in my life actually disliked any of that music, even though now I don&rsquo;t usually voluntarily listen to any of it. I remember as a teenager going on about how terrible boy bands were and how annoying country music is. I&rsquo;ll be honest; I actually like both in certain situations. In fact I have almost every Backstreet Boys song completely memorized and I can sing along with most country songs, and have been able to since I was in Junior High. If I were to get in a group of friends, however, I felt compelled to deny even being able to stand any of that music, because &ldquo;none of my friends did&rdquo;. Looking back, I suspect that none of them really had any serious problem with the music either, but they had to keep up the &ldquo;social norms&rdquo;.</p>

<p>Nobody wants to be the one person in a group that disagrees. It seems like it would be too awkward to handle. I say that’s the best kind of awkward. If other people can&rsquo;t accept a different point of view, they&rsquo;re too closed minded to be worth hanging out with. There&rsquo;s no fun in a group that agrees on everything, because there&rsquo;s no discussion there. You never get to see any other point of view but your own, and who&rsquo;s to say that just because an opinion is yours, it’s the correct one. I mean, if Columbus just went along with everyone else he would have never left Europe, and who knows if we would have ever ended up over here? If the early colonists on the east coast had just went along with what all the soldiers were saying and doing and hadn&rsquo;t stood up for their own opinion, who knows whether our country would even exist as it does today? If you get into a group that talks about something and you don&rsquo;t agree, make yourself heard. You don&rsquo;t have to just go around looking for fights, but if you don&rsquo;t agree with someone, honestly talk it out with them. Be open, because maybe you aren&rsquo;t right, but don&rsquo;t be afraid to be yourself, even it will be a little awkward for a little bit.</p>

<p>On the flip side, there&rsquo;s no reason for you to go around blabbing your opinion and just trying to make yourself right. I think there is definitely a difference between standing up for yourself and your opinions and beliefs and being a loudmouth. The point of bringing up your point is to help people see another side of the argument, not to try to take on the entire group in a debate. So if you see that the group is making good points that refute your argument, there&rsquo;s no reason to jump in and blab your opinion, unless you have some good counter arguments. Anyway, I&rsquo;m getting off track here, so I&rsquo;ll bring it back around.</p>

<p>The idea here is to figure out who you are and then be that person. If you like certain things, don’t pretend not to just to please a crowd, and don&rsquo;t be afraid to stand up for yourself and your beliefs. There&rsquo;s only one person in the whole world who thinks exactly like you do and has what you have to offer, and that&rsquo;s you, so don&rsquo;t rob us all of that person just because &ldquo;society&rdquo; likes a different type right now.</p>

<p>Just be you.</p>
