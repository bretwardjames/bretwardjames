	<p>*Everyone puts their pants on one leg at a time just like you do.</p>

<p>Every once in a while we meet someone who just thinks they are God&rsquo;s gift to mankind. Sometimes it&rsquo;s a co-worker who thinks they know everything there is to know about everything, or a fellow student who adores the sound of their own voice and thinks they have the answers to every question, or just a friend who is always looking down on you and making you feel 2 feet tall. Regardless of who it may be, it&rsquo;s fairly annoying and it has a tendency to alienate people. Here are my words on that subject, and they are directed very strongly to those kinds of people.</p>

<p>GET OVER YOURSELF!</p>

<p>Now, the point of this post isn&rsquo;t to chew anybody out, but rather to provide insights into some situations, so I&rsquo;ll leave the raving at that.</p>

<p>A lot of the time we all end up in that position of arrogance when we know we&rsquo;re right and everyone else is wrong. I know I&rsquo;ve been there plenty; in fact I spent most of high school there. I basically figured that I knew how everyone should live and refused any other opinion or idea because it wasn&rsquo;t my own. I can remember countless times attempting to lecture some of my best friends, thinking that I needed to &ldquo;save&rdquo; them from themselves or they would be lost. I refused to accept that they would be just fine (they all are, by the way, in fact most of them turned out to be better than I did). It turned out that I was the hardest on the people that meant the most to me, even to the point of seriously offending them. I remember there was one instance where I had been such a jerk to one of my best friends that she asked that I completely leave her alone for a while. Even after that I didn’t really learn my lesson. I still tried to hold everyone to my own very high standard, a standard that I found even myself struggling to uphold. It wasn&rsquo;t until I was on my mission and got word that my friend had been killed in a car accident did I really start to contemplate all the crappy things I had done to her and said to her, and how I won’t have a chance in this life to really apologize for any of that. I thought long and hard about how stubbornly proud I had been, and about how many people feelings I had bruised in my attempt to be right and respected. I want to say, to any of you out there who may have been mistreated by me and I haven&rsquo;t adequately apologized, I am so sorry. I am different now, and I can look back and see that I was not the easiest person to get along with back then. Anyway, this is not meant as an apology per se, but I guess that‘s part of the lesson itself.</p>

<p>I think the important lesson here is to realize that as hard as it is to accept, every other person&rsquo;s opinion and ideas are just as valid and carry just as much weight as yours. Just because someone disagrees with you does not make them your enemy. A lot of the time, in fact, both parties are both right and wrong. I have found in life that very seldom are people actually disagreeing when they think they are. A lot of the problem is in the delivery. If another person doesn&rsquo;t just nod their head or say, &ldquo;You&rsquo;re right,&rdquo; then they must be disagreeing, even if their &ldquo;counter-argument&rdquo; actually goes hand in hand with your own. Being right doesn&rsquo;t mean everyone else is wrong, nor is everyone else being wrong a requirement for you to be right.</p>

<p>Pride will always get in the way of important relationships. I don’t know if you&rsquo;ve noticed, but people can in general spot a proud person a mile away, and we generally don&rsquo;t like proud people. Proud people are rude and insensitive; they refuse to accept any opinion or idea but their own, and usually don&rsquo;t have much meaning in life aside from money or career. We all talk about these people like they are someone else, and yet each and every person on the planet is overly proud of something. I know where my proud spots are. I&rsquo;m not proud of them but I recognize that I have work to do. 100% of people who read this and think, &ldquo;He&rsquo;s not talking to me,&rdquo; are completely and utterly wrong.</p>

<p>How do we get rid of pride? This is the eternal question, because pride has been around since the beginning of time and will be around for a quite a while longer. Many religious groups have struggled with overcoming it, but as is apparent, it&rsquo;s still around. I don&rsquo;t claim to have any universal cure, but I do know some things that have worked for me:</p>

<ol>
<li>Let someone else worry about what you want.</li>
</ol>

<p>If everyone on the planet chose one or two people to please and took the time to give them what they want, then everyone on the planet would be satisfied. It&rsquo;s when people start to worry about whether or not they are going to get their way that the whole problem starts. If all we care about is our own way, then all we worry about is ourselves, and we become that proud person that I talked about earlier. My advice: pick someone to worry about and just do what they want, and let someone else worry about what you want. The chances are much more likely than not that there is someone who loves and cares for you enough to do this for you.</p>

<ol>
<li>Honestly consider others&rsquo; opinions and ideas.</li>
</ol>

<p>Just because an idea or opinion isn&rsquo;t yours doesn&rsquo;t mean it can&rsquo;t be right or helpful. Just because someone does a task differently than you doesn&rsquo;t make them wrong, it just makes them different. Even if their way is a little less efficient than yours or seems to actually be more of a bother, maybe they do it that way for a reason that is personal to them. Basically, let people have the right to do things and think in their own personal way.</p>

<ol>
<li>Find some way every day to do something for someone that you don&rsquo;t have to.</li>
</ol>

<p>So often we get caught up in what we are supposed to do that we forget that there are plenty of opportunities to brighten other peoples&rsquo; days for the sake of making them happy. Way too often we only think of what reward we will gain from our service, and we lose sight of the whole purpose and spirit of service. If everyone went out of their way to do something nice for someone else every day, think of how much happier everyone would be. Think about how happy it makes you when someone goes out of their way to make you happy. It might help motivate you to do it yourself.</p>

<p>In conclusion, just get over yourself and think more about others than you do about yourself. Believe me; you&rsquo;re not nearly as cool as you think you are.</p>

<p>*DISCLAIMER: I fully realize that some people put on their pants from a sitting position, and therefore put both feet through at the same time; that is not the point that I am trying to make here. It&rsquo;s an expression, so don&rsquo;t give me crap for it.</p>
