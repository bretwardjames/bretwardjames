	<p>When life gives you lemons….</p>

<p>I’m not sure there is a more intensely platitudinous (how’s that for a GREAT word, eh?) saying. There are lot of good ones, but in my opinion, this one takes the cake.</p>

<p>And yet - if you look past the cliche, and look past all of the empty uses, there is an extremely valuable (and practical) lesson.</p>

<p>The last week it’s pretty much been raining lemons over here. We moved apartments, which isn’t really a lemon in and of itself, but it does take time and energy to do. Moving also requires transferring services which requires a modicum of coordination and organization. Enter the lemons:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>I planned to have the internet service switched from apartment A to apartment B on a Saturday morning (we’d moved most of our furniture into the new unit, so we were just waiting for the internet to be moved so we could bring down the computer and desk, etc.)</p></li>

<li><p>I double checked with AT&amp;T to make sure that the service would be transferred and everything would be ok. I was assured that it would be fine, and that I just needed to wait until 2pm.</p></li>

<li><p>2pm came and went.</p></li>

<li><p>I called AT&amp;T, they said the service order couldn’t go through because of a billing issue. Fair enough, I’d missed the notification on that.</p></li>

<li><p>I resolved the billing error, called them back, assuming they could just push the self-install order through right then.</p></li>

<li><p>They said they couldn’t push the order through until the next Wednesday. I immediately gained a whole deeper level of understanding for the old Brian Regan “Phone Company” bit. So we decided to leave the desk and equipment upstairs where the internet was still working until the next Wednesday.</p></li>

<li><p>On Tuesday night I moved all of the computer equipment down.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Wednesday morning, I called again to ensure the service would be turned on as scheduled, and the automated system said it would be turned on the NEXT Wednesday, but that the service in the other unit had been successfully turned off. (Fun times)</p>

<ol>
<li><p>I found my way to a live rep, who said that the internet was supposed to have been turned on the day before, but their system had made an error, and he couldn’t see exactly why it wasn’t on. He also informed me that the self-install option wouldn’t work, and they needed to send a technician out, but that the earliest they could send someone was the next day.</p></li>

<li><p>I worked from my phone that day, and waited until about noon the next day when the tech finally showed up. Of course, when they turned on the internet, they downgraded us from 1000mbps internet to 5mbps. Not sure if you have experienced 5mbps internet in the last decade or so, but it flat out doesn’t cut it. So I was back working from my phone while I contacted their support to get everything back how it was before.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Woke up the next day, positive attitude, carpe diem, all that. Jumped on my computer, network speed test has it at 50mbps (not nearly where it’s supposed to be but manageable). And then the fire alarms start going off. The dog really doesn’t like that.</p>

<ol>
<li>So we go outside, work from the phone (again) and try to figure out a way to sell 12 GALLONS of lemonade from all the lemons from the week.</li>
</ol>

<p>About this point, I realized this very important point:</p>

<p>If’ it’s not one thing, it’s something else. Life doesn’t hand out lemons occasionally. Life is just a constant stream of lemons.</p>

<p>The question is, are you going to complain about it, or just make the lemonade and get on with it?</p>
