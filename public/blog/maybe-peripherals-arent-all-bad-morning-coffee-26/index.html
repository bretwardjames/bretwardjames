	<p>I&rsquo;ve raved against depending on peripherals lately, but I think there is a caveat to that. I think depending on tools and gadgets can be fine if they are actually essential to the finished product.</p>

<p>But most of the time, we just hide behind them in an attempt to hide the actual product.</p>

<p>I have been as guilty (if not MORE) than anyone of hiding behind fancy gizmos so that the real me wasn&rsquo;t exposed, because I wasn&rsquo;t very confident in myself.</p>

<p>But at the same time, I have always DEMANDED of myself that I can be capable of doing anything, from anywhere, at any time. And those same tools that I&rsquo;ve hid behind and used as an excuse have been crucial to my ability to hold myself to that standard.</p>

<p>So I guess I consider those tools and gadgets to actually be a part of me, an extension of me. They allow me to scale myself beyond what most people are capable of.</p>

<p>But it forces me to walk a fine line between depending on those peripherals to the point where the core content is hidden and using those peripherals as what they are: tools.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s like a glove or a hat. Those can become extensions of who you are (think Michael Jackson&rsquo;s glove, or even the hats that I&rsquo;ve been wearing a lot lately), but they are not who you are.</p>

<p>They can help make a point, but they are not THE point.</p>

<p>So maybe the point isn’t quite as extreme as get rid of all your peripherals, but rather, make sure you’re using them for what they are.</p>
