	<p>If you’re running Facebook ads, you probably don’t have an unlimited budget. (side note - if you do have an unlimited budget, my hat goes off to you. also, you should give me some)</p>

<p>The problem with being on a limited budget is keeping track of how much you’re spending across the various campaigns that you’re running, not to mention the posts that you’re boosting.</p>

<p>However, there’s a little hack you can use to make sure that no matter what you do, your monthly ad spend will always be the same.</p>

<p>Here’s how you do it:</p>

<ol>
<li>Consolidate Your Campaigns
The first thing you need to do is create 3-5 campaigns, organized by preferred outcome.</li>
</ol>

<p>You may end up with more or less campaigns depending on whether you release video content. You’ll want to have a campaign for each type of content. So if you have videos, you’ll want a campaign optimized for video views. If you have blog content, you’ll want a campaign optimized for content views (viewContent). If you have content that is intended to get someone to take some action outside Facebook, you’ll want a campaign optimized for conversions. So, assuming you release videos on a regular basis, these are the campaigns you’d have:</p>

<p>Awareness (optimized for brand awareness)</p>

<p>Video Engagement (optimized for video views)</p>

<p>Content Engagement (optimized for viewContent)</p>

<p>Action (optimized for conversions)</p>

<ol>
<li>Campaign Budget Optimization
The next thing you need to do is set all of your campaigns to optimize the spend at the campaign level:</li>
</ol>

<p><img src="Screen Shot 2019-01-07 at 8.51.51 AM.png" alt="Campaign Budget" /></p>

<p>You can set each campaign to a limited budget of as low as $2/day (around $65/mo). That would total out to $8/day across all 4 of the campaigns (or $260/mo).</p>

<ol>
<li>Configure the Campaigns for Cold and Warm Audience Targeting
Within each of the above campaigns, set up ad sets to distinguish between target groups. I normally have 3 ad sets per campaign:</li>
</ol>

<p><img src="Screen Shot 2019-01-07 at 9.57.19 AM.png" alt="Audience Rollups" /></p>

<p>Warm audience rollup - basically anyone that has engaged in any way (watched video, clicked to website, liked/commented/shared post, etc)</p>

<p>Cold lookalike rollup - all of your lookalike audiences combined.</p>

<p>Cold interest rollup - targeting based on interest only (no custom audiences).</p>

<p>I also like to make the audiences mutually exclusive, so I’ll exclude my lookalike audiences from the Warm and Interest rollups, the Warm Audience from the Cold Rollups, etc.</p>

<p>And now for the secret sauce.</p>

<ol>
<li>Add New Content To Existing Campaigns
Now, when you release new content, instead of boosting the post individually, simply add it to the existing campaign based on the type of content and who should see it.</li>
</ol>

<p>So if you release a new video intended for your followers, here’s what you do:</p>

<p><img src="Screen Shot 2019-01-07 at 9.47.15 AM.png" alt="Campaign Setup" /></p>

<p>Navigate to the Video Engagement campaign</p>

<p>Select the Warm Audience Rollup ad set</p>

<p>Click “Create” to create a new ad</p>

<p>Select “Use Existing Post”</p>

<p>Select your post</p>

<p>Publish</p>

<p>The really cool thing is that it doesn’t matter where the post was originally released (Facebook/Instagram), because it can be promoted on both platforms at the same time (assuming the video isn’t longer than 1 minute).</p>

<p>The wrap-up
Setting up your campaigns this way will help you organize your content by use, but more importantly it helps you keep your ad spend predictable. Instead of creating a new campaign for every post, you’re simply using the campaigns that already exist, and adding the content to those.</p>

<p>On a regular basis, it’s a good idea to go back through and disable the content that isn’t performing as well, so that you can make way for fresh content.</p>
