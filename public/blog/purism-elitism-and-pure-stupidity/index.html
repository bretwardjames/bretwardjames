	<p>I want to try and stay away from too much diatribing; I want to have a lot of momentum when I really need it down the road ;)That being said, I wanted to bring up another question that I have been toying with in my head for a while. I think the title of this post not only gives away a good portion of the question, but also my personal stance, but I want to talk for a second about it and then see what you all think.</p>

<p>So I was playing volleyball tonight, and one of the girls showed one of the most elitist and purist attitudes that I’ve seen in a long time, and I’ve played volleyball with the elitistest of the elitist. We had 7 people, and we decided to play doubles king of the court, to make the game a little more interesting. That was fun for a while, and then a couple more people showed up, and we could then play 5 on 4, which is a fine number of people in my opinion. She felt differently, which was fine, but she didn’t just express that opinion, but continued to complain about it as we started playing. Then , when one of the people had to leave, we had even 4’s, and she looked around at her team, and with an unmistakable look of disdain at the team she was left with, just walked off the court and left. I thought to myself, that’s fine if she had to leave, but it looked a lot to me like she just didn’t want to play with people who “weren’t as good as she” was. (note: She’s not really that good of a player).So here’s my question. In this situation, do you think that kind of elitist attitude is justified? Or in any kind of similar situation, do you feel justified in declining to participate in some activity because of the seeming lack of qualifications of the other participants?</p>
