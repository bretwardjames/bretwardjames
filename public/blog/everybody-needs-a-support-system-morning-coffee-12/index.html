	<p>The way you feel about what you&rsquo;re doing is soooo closely linked to how well you do it.</p>

<p>If you feel like you suck at something, the likelihood that you&rsquo;re going to do it well is slim to none at best.</p>

<p>Keeping a positive attitude can have a MASSIVE impact on your output.</p>

<p>Surrounding yourself with people that you trust can help get you through the days when you think you suck, because those people can remind you of your potential.</p>

<p>The flipside of that coin, however, is that positive attitude alone can&rsquo;t win the game for you.  Nobody ever succeeded around yes-men.</p>

<p>Can you imagine if Floyd Mayweather&rsquo;s coaches and teammates only ever told him how awesome he is? Would we even know his name?</p>

<p>Hell to the naw.</p>

<p>Floyd is who he is because he had people to pick him up when he was down, but those same people beat him down when he was too full of himself.</p>

<p>The same is true for anyone that you know that&rsquo;s been successful.</p>

<p>Having a network of trusted people that can be your support system, but also that can check your ego and your bad ideas is CRUCIAL!</p>
