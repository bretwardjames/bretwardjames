<article style="max-width:890px" class="container w-100 my-5">
	<p>So I was in my writing class today (it&rsquo;s actually a philosophy class but that has nothing to do with anything) and my professor pointed something out that I simply will not accept. There&rsquo;s nothing wrong with my professor; he&rsquo;s a great man. He just happens to be the guy who has to say these ridiculous things.</p>

<p>So we are talking about grammar and spelling and things and we were each given a paper with statements that supposedly had grammatical errors that we were to correct. One of these statements went something like this:</p>

<p>Although the candidate is new to politics she has a good chance at winning.</p>

<p>It turns out that there isn&rsquo;t anything grammatically wrong with that sentence, but my professor used this sentence to bring up the issue of sexism in writing. According to the Modern Language Association (MLA), &ldquo;Grammar checkers are good at flagging obviously sexist terms, such as mankind and fireman, but they do not flag language that might be demeaning to women (woman doctor) or stereotypical (referring to assistants as women and lawyers as men, for instance). They also have no way of identifying the generic use of he or his (An obstetrician needs to be available to his patients anytime, day or night). You must use your common sense to tell when a word or a construction is offensive.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Even more disturbing that than is a list of words that I can no longer use apparently because they are sexist. Here are some examples:</p>

<p>Anchorman</p>

<p>Chairman</p>

<p>Clergyman</p>

<p>Congressman</p>

<p>Fireman</p>

<p>Foreman</p>

<p>Mailman</p>

<p>To man (verb)</p>

<p>Mankind</p>

<p>Manpower</p>

<p>Policeman</p>

<p>Salesman</p>

<p>Weatherman</p>

<p>Workman</p>

<p>Now I have to genericize those words so as to not offend women. The most outrageous part of the whole thing is the fact that while using the word &ldquo;he&rdquo; to signify a generic gender is sexist, the word &ldquo;she&rdquo; in the same context used for the same purpose is not sexist, but is considered perfectly acceptable. It&rsquo;s affirmative action all over again. </p>

<p>To save this from becoming a novel, which it very easily could, I will just say my two cents and you&rsquo;ll get my drift.</p>

<p>If you think I&rsquo;m sexist,you are sexist.</p>
