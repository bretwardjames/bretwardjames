	<p>I came out of high school really wanting to go into music education. I wanted to be a choir teacher at some junior college somewhere, and eventually get the opportunity to conduct a university choir.</p>

<p>And I was GOOD, by the way. Still am, although I&rsquo;m out of practice.</p>

<p>But somewhere along the line, I let someone convince me that there was no money in music.</p>

<p>And from that moment on, it became &ldquo;clear&rdquo; to me that the right choice was to pursue law, and leave music behind altogether.</p>

<p>At the time, I figured I knew enough about how life worked that the decision to abandon the music and do law was the &ldquo;right&rdquo; choice.</p>

<p>If only I knew then what I know now.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s not that I regret where I&rsquo;ve ended up. I am really happy with my life. My experiences have shaped me into who I&rsquo;ve become.</p>

<p>But I can&rsquo;t help but wonder whether I&rsquo;d have become a better version of myself if I&rsquo;d stuck with what I wanted to do.</p>

<p>The truth is, there was no possible way for me to know how my choice back then was going to work out for me.</p>

<p>But I was CONVINCED, not only that I was making the right decision, but that it was the ONLY right decision.</p>

<p>And since then, I&rsquo;ve been in so many situations where I&rsquo;ve been absolutely convinced that something is true, only to find out later that I was completely mistaken.</p>

<p>We can&rsquo;t really know anything for certain - the math is too big.</p>

<p>There are way too many variables to consider for us to actually think we can predict any outcome.</p>

<p>And yet we do it all the time. We make decisions based on these &ldquo;informed&rdquo; hypotheses that are really just uneducated guesses.</p>

<p>No matter how convinced you are of something, life will show you an angle you weren&rsquo;t expecting.</p>

<p>Best thing to do is exactly what you want - because whether you choose the &ldquo;wise&rdquo; or the &ldquo;foolish&rdquo; route, the net result is the same:</p>

<p>You get some things right. You get most things wrong. Life beats you down, and then you have a few amazing moments.</p>
