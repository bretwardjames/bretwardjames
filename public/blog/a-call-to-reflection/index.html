	<p>For the last few months, I&rsquo;ve had a certain thought on my mind, and just recently it has developed into an opinion. Those of you who are unfortunate enough to know me are aware of the catastrophe that follows any instance of a thought becoming an opinion in my mind. Usually, I repeat my opinion ad nauseam to anyone that is bored enough or confined enough to sit through it. I think maybe this is my way of solidifying the opinion within myself, not unlike practice of a musical instrument solidifies the technique and notes in the musician. In any case, I have tried (somewhat unsuccessfully) to keep it to myself until I could formulate it into a post here, so you can simply read it and be done with it. For those to whom I&rsquo;ve already begun the unceasing flapping of my jaws on this topic, I apologize for past grievances and assure you that this might be the last time you have to hear it. The only thing I ask is that you not stop halfway through. I am aware that some of what I say will be slightly offensive in some way or another to everyone that reads this. If you don&rsquo;t feel like getting a little pricked, don&rsquo;t even bother to read at all. But if you start into this, please try to read all the way to the end.</p>

<p>That being said:</p>

<p>The past three years have been very informative for me. Obviously I&rsquo;ve spent quite a bit of time in the classroom during that time, and so I&rsquo;ve been informed in that respect. That will not be the topic of discussion here. I want to talk about the other ways in which these past three years have been informative. Specifically, I want to talk about Mormons.</p>

<p>Mormons are an interesting subset of the population. I don&rsquo;t know that there is another demographic that is quite as paradoxical, statistically speaking. For example, Mormons are generally known as &ldquo;the nice family down the street,&rdquo; or &ldquo;very clean.&rdquo; Many references are made to our abstinence from alcohol and tobacco, and more especially from coffee and tea. Many comment on our strict abstinence from sexual relations outside of marriage, and our doctrinal abhorrence of pornography and masturbation. These last two are particularly strange to many people, but we are respected for them nonetheless. We are portrayed as having some strange rules, but overall being a very agreeable, sensible, and kind people. At the same time, Mormons are statistically famous for having the highest percentage of dependency on anti-depressant drugs. A much less well known statistic shows that of men who admit to having indulged in pornographic materials, most are from Utah. Utah leads the porn-subscription percentages (number of pornographic subscriptions per 1000 households, here&rsquo;s the study <a href="http://people.hbs.edu/bedelman/papers/redlightstates.pdf">http://people.hbs.edu/bedelman/papers/redlightstates.pdf</a>). Of course, not everyone in Utah is Mormon, but over half of them are, meaning the number of coincidences between the two groups (i.e. porn subscribers and Mormons) is inevitably quite substantial. And let&rsquo;s not forget BYU students. Regardless of what you may have heard, a large majority of current BYU students are inconsiderate, immoral, dishonest, and flat out mean. I realize that in comparison with any other university, BYU can boast that it is home to the best of the best, but here in Provo, it&rsquo;s a different story. (Disclaimer: I&rsquo;m not accusing all BYU students equally, so if you read this and are offended that I would make such allegations, I&rsquo;m probably not talking about you)This brings me to point #1.</p>

<p>Over Christmas break, I went to a party with some friends from high school. All of them drank at the party. It wasn&rsquo;t a loud, boisterous drinking party, but I was the only one not drinking some sort of alcoholic beverage, and I felt totally comfortable and accepted by them. There was no pretense, there was no unnecessary joking, just friends getting together to spend time together. Did I mention that some of them have expressed (not to me, of course) a severe dislike of Mormons? In spite of what must have been serious religious differences, they were able to have a pleasant evening with us, and I daresay that despite my still being Mormon, I made some friends that night. I haven&rsquo;t really felt that way in relation to any of my fellow Brigham-ites since then, with a few exceptions. In other words, I, a staunch Mormon, felt more comfortable around non-Mormons who dislike Mormons and who were drinking than I ever do around BYU students (*Mormon BYU students). It&rsquo;s not even so much a matter of feeling comfortable as it is feeling accepted. I felt completely accepted by them, whereas I find myself purposefully excluded from many circles here at BYU. I see a problem.</p>

<p><strong>Point #2</strong>. To address the statistical paradox mentioned earlier, it&rsquo;s important to look at it objectively. This is not a call to repentance, so I&rsquo;m not breathing hell-fire and damnation. What I&rsquo;m trying to do is open the reader&rsquo;s eyes a little and hopefully instill a desire for serious personal reflection and self-examination. Mormons abuse anti-depressants. Why? There are all kinds of possible explanations, the most popular being a need to &ldquo;keep up with the Jones&rsquo;.&rdquo; My boss mentioned another which I consider equally valid. He said, &ldquo;Mormons self medicate with anti-depressants because they aren&rsquo;t self medicating with drugs and alcohol like the rest of the world.&rdquo; Or what about the pornography question? I think the reason is that Mormons have been deceived by popular media into thinking that sexual gratification is the sole purpose of life. I agree with all of these ideas, but I think the real root of the problem is a little deeper, and more over-arching. Mormons feel the need to &ldquo;keep up with the Jones&rsquo;&rdquo; and are particularly susceptible to pornography because Mormon society has placed greater value on the appearance of belief than on belief itself.</p>

<p><strong>Point #3.</strong> Let&rsquo;s look at a few instances of Mormon culture and see if what I&rsquo;m saying holds. We&rsquo;ll start with Fast and Testimony meeting. We all know the stereotypical Fast and Testimony meeting script. If you&rsquo;ve seen The Singles&rsquo; Ward, then you know exactly what I&rsquo;m talking about. I&rsquo;ve been a member of the church for close to 25 years, and I&rsquo;ve almost never missed a Fast and Testimony meeting in that time, that I can remember. The thing that I&rsquo;ve learned about them is that there are certain things that you say when giving your testimony. For example, &ldquo;I know the church is true,&rdquo; or, &ldquo;Joseph Smith is a true prophet,&rdquo; or, &ldquo;President &hellip; is a true prophet,&rdquo; or, &ldquo;I am so grateful for this opportunity to share my testimony,&rdquo; etc. We have this system of stock phrases, and deviation from those stock phrases is considered improper on some level. There are a lot of things about which I could talk in this regard, but I&rsquo;ll focus on one particular example and on one broad principle.</p>

<p>The particular example is using the phrase &ldquo;I know.&rdquo; We are constantly berated with people telling us that they know the church is true, or they know that the Book of Mormon is true. What this has done is foster an environment in which it is not OK to not know those things. If everyone else knows, and I don&rsquo;t know, then I am somehow on a lower spiritual level than they are. In other words, if I don&rsquo;t know, then I&rsquo;m sinning in some way. But I don&rsquo;t feel like I&rsquo;m sinning by not knowing, so rather than give the impression to everyone else that I am sinning, I&rsquo;ll just say that I know to avoid the awkwardness.</p>

<p>The broad principle, which also somewhat applies here, is that we tend to use stock phrases as space-fillers in talks, prayers, Sunday School lessons, for fear of not having something to say, or for fear of saying the wrong thing. For example, in prayers, we almost invariably open our prayers with some combination of the following words, &ldquo;Our dear, kind, gracious Father in Heaven/Heavenly Father,&rdquo; immediately after which we thank God for &ldquo;this day,&rdquo; and at some point in the prayer we ask God to bless our food to &ldquo;nourish and strengthen our bodies.&rdquo; The most ironic part about that last phrase is that it does not matter what food we are eating, we always ask that it will nourish and strengthen our bodies. We bless salads, sandwiches, pancakes, burgers, steak, ice cream, onion rings, KFC, twinkies, and on certain occasions (firesides) cookies, donuts, and soda, to &ldquo;nourish and strengthen our bodies.&rdquo; Now, I&rsquo;m not going to try to make an exhaustive list of these filler phrases, but I think you get my drift here. There are certain words and phrases that we use simply because that&rsquo;s what culture dictates.</p>

<p><strong>Point #4.</strong> Both of these examples, which do not by any means constitute and exhaustive list, show very clearly the importance that Mormon culture has placed on the appearance of righteousness (goodness, strength, etc.). I want to talk about another, more serious one. This, I think, is the absolute epitome of the problem. I&rsquo;ve noticed, not only in myself, but also through anecdotal evidence, that Mormons are afraid to admit that they make mistakes. I&rsquo;m not talking about little unimportant mistakes, but bigger, almost membership-jeopardizing mistakes. We are very quick to point out that, in general, we all make mistakes. We are all, in theory, humble, but in actuality, how many of us put on a mask to hide the very serious problems with which we are struggling? How many young men in the church wait until they are caught to discuss sexual addictions with parents or priesthood leaders? How often do grown men, fathers and husbands, do the same? Missionaries, out of fear of being sent home, hide things from their mission presidents. When missionaries do get sent home, they are talked about in hushed whispers in the back of the chapel, &ldquo;I wonder what he did.&rdquo; We, as members of the church, are so attached to the image of righteousness that we feel we are expected to wear that we use it to cover up the problems that eat at us from the inside. And so we struggle on, hoping beyond reason that somehow we will be strong enough to overcome sin by ourselves. And then we raise our hand in Sunday School and talk of the doctrine of the Atonement, cleverly and beautifully describing how no person can overcome sin alone. Do you see the problem here?</p>

<p><strong>Point #5</strong>. I think it&rsquo;s obvious where I&rsquo;m going with this. Let&rsquo;s take each of the three examples and dissect it a little.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>&ldquo;I know.&rdquo; I would venture to say that, among the membership of the church (13 mill) about 200 people actually &ldquo;know&rdquo; anything in this way. How does one come to a real knowledge of spiritual things? It is not by spiritual revelation alone, but by physical manifestation accompanied by spiritual revelation. Joseph Smith knew that God existed, because he saw Him. I would venture to say that the general authorities of the church know of these things because they are given some sort of physical manifestation along with their calling. Maybe they don&rsquo;t see God as Joseph did, but I believe there is more than just the whispering of the Spirit, and I don&rsquo;t just mean signs or coincidences. I&rsquo;m talking about irrefutable physical evidence which touches them specifically and proves to them that these things are true. They are called to be special witnesses of Christ, meaning those who can say that they know, not because they felt it, but because they have experienced it. I also think that there are an elect few of the &ldquo;lay members&rdquo; of the church who have experienced this sort of physical manifestation, but that number cannot be greater than 20 or 30, as I see it. So why do we say that we &ldquo;know&rdquo; of these things? Simple. Because that&rsquo;s what you say. We hear in General Conference and from Alma that we are supposed to know certain things. The Bible says that to some is given to know, and others to believe on their words. We take all this to mean that believing is somehow less important than knowing, and we all want to be the ones that know. Somehow we are less spiritual if we just believe, as opposed to knowing. Our interpretation of Alma 34 has convinced us that we should be at the stage where our faith has become dormant, because we have knowledge. How pretentious of us. How incredibly irrational of us. How perfect do we think we are? Those to whom it is given to know are those who are called to be special witnesses. That is a very small number of people, comprising the First Presidency, Council of the Twelve, Quorums of the Seventy, The General Presidencies of the Relief Society, Young Men, Young Women, and Primary, and the Presiding Bishopric. To the rest of us is given to believe on their words. That is why they are called. Alma is talking about faith in his entire discourse, and merely mentions the fact that once we know, our faith becomes dormant. He&rsquo;s trying to get us to understand that we need to have faith, not knowledge, until we are called upon to have that knowledge. The point here is this: You&rsquo;ll know when you know. It will be obvious. There will be no question left in your mind. It will be a big deal. If you&rsquo;re reading this, chances are you haven&rsquo;t had that experience (unless somehow someone in Salt Lake hears about this and takes a gander, scary thought), and therefore you don&rsquo;t know. The beautiful thing, as I&rsquo;ll point out soon, is that you don&rsquo;t have to know. It&rsquo;s perfectly OK not to know.</p></li>

<li><p>Filler words and stock phrases. I only pointed out a handful of these stock phrases, but we all know that there are absolutely hundreds of these types of stock phrases. We use them because we feel obligated to a sense of consistency or because we don&rsquo;t want to sound abnormal, which in a community of &ldquo;perfectly righteous&rdquo; Mormons can only mean that you are an outsider, or not perfectly righteous. Here&rsquo;s the problem. A solid third of what we say in Mormon settings (church, seminary, religion classes, etc.) is nothing more than hot air. We don&rsquo;t believe or mean what we&rsquo;re saying, because we&rsquo;re just using stock phrases. Christ called them &ldquo;vain repetitions.&rdquo; I think too often we overlook the principles that the scriptures are so blatantly trying to teach us. We are very focused on gaining the deep knowledge, and so we miss the obvious things. This is a perfect example. (Now, I&rsquo;ll warn the reader, the next few lines of this post will probably offend you, so steel yourself.) I think what Christ had in mind when He said &ldquo;vain repetitions&rdquo; is most adequately summed up in the contemporary wording of that idea: bullshit. I don&rsquo;t think it necessary to go into the particulars of what constitutes bullshit; for that I highly recommend that the you read the definitive work on the subject by Harry Frankfurt, entitled &ldquo;On Bullshit.&ldquo; I do want to talk a little more about the particular application here, however. I think that these stock phrases that we use, because of the lack of real emotional connection that we have to them, are all just plain bullshit (I&rsquo;ll abbreviate it to b.s. from now on). I think that if you read Frankfurt&rsquo;s article, you will most readily agree with me on this point. B.S. is simply the act of presenting oneself as being in a certain state of mind (i.e. believing something, meaning what one says, having a connection to one&rsquo;s words, etc.) when in fact one is not in that state of mind. So here, it is b.s. to use words simply because they are stock phrases, or to use filler words to avoid silence, or even worse, to fill our prayers with these stock phrases or filler words. The words we use should be directly connected with our emotions and our desires, and if we say anything, ever, that is not directly connected to some personal feeling or belief or desire, we are b.s.-ing. In other words, any time we say something that we don&rsquo;t actually mean to say (that&rsquo;s what I mean by emotional connection), what we have said is b.s. I&rsquo;ve already shown that we do this all the time, so where does that leave us? Here&rsquo;s where: Mormons are full of b.s.! (Don&rsquo;t worry, the world will be happy again soon)</p></li>

<li><p>Hiding our mistakes. I see this most prevalently in myself. Of course, being that close to the problem makes me a bit of an expert on it, and so I recognize the signs that someone is hiding something. Let me tell you about that for a little. The most obvious sign that someone is hiding something, whether it be a mistake or just problems in general, is that they seem to have everything going for them. Their life seems quite perfect in every way. They are always happy, always laughing and smiling, and are generally very fun to be around. Reality check: Nobody&rsquo;s life is that perfect. Granted, there are those who can be happy even when their circumstances are terrible, but the difference is that these people don&rsquo;t try to hide the problems. They don&rsquo;t flaunt them, but usually when you know someone that is happy in spite of circumstances, you know about the circumstances. Otherwise you&rsquo;d have no way of knowing that they are happy in spite of something. Now, this mask of happiness that people use to hide their problems creates an ironic and paradoxical problem, especially in Mormon culture. As with the other examples we&rsquo;ve seen, Mormons equate any departure from the norm as an indication of an outsider, and an outsider of a seriously religious and righteous group is by definition a sinner. I realize how ridiculous that logic sounds on paper, but I promise, that is exactly how it works. So what we get is a large group of people who all see how perfect everyone else&rsquo;s life is, and think that if their lives aren&rsquo;t as perfect as everyone else&rsquo;s, then they must be doing something wrong. In an effort to not come across as sinning, they, and in turn, we all, simply sweep our problems under the rug, hoping that if nobody else sees them, the problems will vanish. The problem here is obvious; everyone seems to have the perfect life, and nobody actually does. Nobody&rsquo;s life is nearly as perfect as they let on. The real problem comes when this is applied to serious transgressions that need to be confessed to proper authority. These go unresolved because we want to avoid the appearance of having made a mistake. We are so afraid of the social consequences of our actions becoming known that we completely disregard the eternal consequences of not resolving the problems. Here&rsquo;s the one-liner that I think sums up this whole bullet point quite nicely: You don&rsquo;t have to be happy all the time to be happy.</p></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Pre-conclusion #1</strong></p>

<p>What is the point of all this? Simple. Mormon culture has placed too great an emphasis on the appearance of believing, and all but left out actual belief. The result is that the large majority of Mormons act like they believe without any shadow of a doubt in the doctrine of the Church without having any real belief. In other words, we say (by our words, actions, demeanor) that we &ldquo;know the Church is true&rdquo; when in reality we don&rsquo;t have a clue whether it&rsquo;s true or not, or whether we really even care. If you feel like I&rsquo;m challenging your faith or trying to shake your belief in Christ or the Church, good. That is exactly the point of this whole post. I am very actively attacking your beliefs and faith. I&rsquo;m digging right into your heart, opening it up and showing it to the world so everyone will know that belief is not to be found there. Why am I doing this? Because if every Mormon really believed in what we are taught, the problems that I&rsquo;ve brought up here would not exist. It&rsquo;s as simple as that. Even if the majority of Mormons really believed, those problems would go away. And yet there they are, sitting in front of you. Therefore, not even a majority of Mormons can possibly have any kind of real belief, and because of this, the chances are just better than 50% that you are one of those that doesn&rsquo;t actually believe, but instead just affirms belief. So yes, I am challenging you.</p>

<p><strong>Pre-conclusion #2</strong></p>

<p>Why am I so viciously attacking you like this? Again, simple. I want you to see your reaction. There are basically three ways that you can react to this.</p>

<ol>
<li>You can either get extremely offended, defensive, and even angry that I would dare to challenge your faith.</li>
<li>You can simply shrug your shoulders and not care.</li>
<li>You can look yourself in the mirror and honestly ask yourself, &ldquo;Do I believe?&rdquo;</li>
</ol>

<p>I suspect that your initial reaction was the first. I hope it wasn&rsquo;t the second. I forgive you for having either of those initial reactions. I sincerely hope that regardless of your initial reaction, you will do number 3 once you finish reading this. Here is why:</p>

<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>

<p>At the end of the day (i.e. when we stand before God to be judged), it won&rsquo;t matter how righteous or faithful we appeared to be. God doesn&rsquo;t really care what the Jones&rsquo;s thought about how strong of a testimony we had. He is concerned with you. He wants to see whether or not you actually do believe, and whether you are willing to act on that belief. What other people think has absolutely no significance whatsoever. Your testimony, your righteousness, your worth, are all between God and you. Just you. So do yourself and me a favor. Forget about what everyone else does. Forget what other people think about you. Forget about needing to &ldquo;know.&rdquo; Forget about needing to look righteous. Whoever you are, wherever you live, go find the nearest mirror, look yourself in the eyes, and ask yourself, &ldquo;What do I really believe?&rdquo; And don&rsquo;t move a muscle until you&rsquo;ve realized/decided what it is that you, in isolation from every other human being on the planet, actually believe. It doesn&rsquo;t matter what it is that you believe as much as it matters that you know that the belief is 100% yours. If you do this, I promise it will be the most spiritually cathartic experience that you&rsquo;ve ever had. The most important part, however, is that when you talk about it (in testimony meeting), only say those words which come from inside you. Don&rsquo;t say you know if you don&rsquo;t know. Don&rsquo;t say you believe in things in which you don&rsquo;t believe. Just say the words that come from your heart. Your heart. Express you.</p>
