	<p>It&rsquo;s been a matter of intense debate and discussion, this battle between the sexes. For centuries, men and women of all ages have been trying to prove that their sex, referring to gender, is superior to the other. My point here is to show how no matter how you construe it, neither of the sexes is any better than the other, and how amazingly well men and women complement each other, and in so doing, answer the posed question, why are men and women perfect for each other.</p>

<p>To begin, there are some obvious distributions of natural ability, found in one of the sexes far more often than in the other. No one would debate, for example, the capability of a woman to be more tender, warm, and loving than a man, and no one in their right mind would debate the man&rsquo;s natural sense of physical strength, and emotional control. (Remember, I am not speaking about each person as an individual, but more about general natures.) Women are more tender, warm, willing to genuinely compliment. Women have a tendency to be much more organized, and seem to have a knack for financial frugality and fidelity, at least in their more mature years. Women are far more attractive than men, and are much more attentive to matters of hygiene and appearance. Meticulous is a word that much more often describes a woman than a man. And, of course, there is a thing called motherhood that men just can&rsquo;t pull off. Women not only were built for it physically, but they have the psychological know-how that men just can&rsquo;t duplicate. There is nothing like a mother&rsquo;s influence in the early years of a child&rsquo;s life. The list, of course, could continue for a long time, and had I time, I would continue. in order, however, to make the point, we must turn our attention to the male half of the human race.</p>

<p>Men have strengths in different places than women do. Men are more naturally strong in a physical sense, never afraid to just go do it. Men have that numb-skulled go get &lsquo;er-ness that is great for getting things done. Men are all about talk less and do more. Men are far more reserved emotionally than women, and that reservedness tends to spill over into social life, as well. Women tend to talk, while men sort of stand there. Men, as a whole, thanks to that emotional reservedness, are more suited for the work force, where it doesn’t really matter how you feel, as much as &ldquo;go do it.&rdquo; A man is more suited to be the breadwinner for a family for the same reasons. Day in, day out, go do it. Men are great for shoulders to cry on, arms to cry in, and a sense of protection from the storms of life. I think that’s all the good things that I can say about men, so I&rsquo;ll continue on to my next point.</p>

<p>Where there are pluses, there must be minuses, and both sexes, in turn, have areas that are lacking, at least in the view of the other sex. I attribute this misunderstanding between men and women to one simple fact: Women think too much, and men don&rsquo;t think at all. If I had more time, I would prove that statement with examples, but for now it will suffice to say that most of the frustration and confusion between the two is that women thing so much about everything, and want men to do so as well, while on the other hand, men don’t take things for much more than face value, and wish that women would just mean what they say, and say what they mean. And we see why men will never understand women, and why women will always be frustrated with men. I am not trying to say that one is better, and the other should change, it’s good for both sexes, because as they learn to live with each other, the man begins to read the little signals that his wife is constantly sending, and begins to pay more attention to those, than to what she is actually saying. He never really fully grasps it, because he will always make mistakes, but whatever. And on the other hand, the wife learns to dumb down her speech a little bit for her husband&rsquo;s benefit. One could, from a neuter standpoint, neither defending or offending men or women, deduce that there are in fact no inherently bad qualities, or defects in either sex, just different ones that complement each other.</p>

<p>So we see that men and women complement each other. Why are women so beautiful and men so ugly, well, someone needs to be good looking, and someone needs to have looks that can get thrown into the dirt a little? Why are women more organized? Because men aren&rsquo;t. Why are women more emotional than men? Because men are their foundation. Why are men more reserved about emotion? Because they are the foundation of the women. They are the shoulder to cry on. Why are women so concerned about their appearance? Because if they weren&rsquo;t we&rsquo;d all look like slobs. Why do men go to the office all day, and take the kids to dinner when mom isn&rsquo;t around? Because not only are women better cooks, men can&rsquo;t cook.</p>

<p>The point of this whole thing is to point out that really, women and men are equal, and neither is better or worse. Of course, most women do a better job at what they do than men, but thats not what we&rsquo;re talking about&hellip;&hellip;</p>
