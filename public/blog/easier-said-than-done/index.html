<article style="max-width:890px" class="container w-100 my-5">
	<p>I came to a shocking realization this morning, and it has a lot to do with a slight misunderstanding of that phrase, “easier said than done.” I think I’ve spent my whole life taking the easy way out. Let me explain:</p>

<p>Before this morning, I thought that the point of that phrase, “easier said than done,&lsquo;” was focused on explaining one’s inability to perform or difficulty in performing an action by pointing out the relative difficulty of performing that task to giving it. It was an excuse, for all intents and purposes.</p>

<p>Then, this morning, I came to this startling realization. I had been applying this phrase to my life, but in a little bit different of a way. Instead of making the excuse that something was harder to do than to say, I was simply making the excuse that since I was saying it, I need not be concerned too much with actually doing it. I’ve had the attitude for too long that writing in this blog about a certain topic not only makes me an expert on that topic, but also infers that I am already doing everything that I write about.</p>

<p>Take, for example, the post that I wrote about just doing, not trying. I wrote that with all the idealist zeal of an intellectual, and yet I continue to demand that people who are disappointed in my continued inability to perform a certain task at least give me credit for trying. If I can’t live it, what right do I have to write it?</p>

<p>What I mean when I say that I’ve spent my whole life taking the easy way out is this: It is much easier to talk about doing something than to actually do it, and most of the time, the more you talk about something, the less you are actually doing it. At least that is the case with me. I’ve been taking the easy way out by talking about all of the things that I want to be doing, instead of just doing them.</p>

<p>I’m not going to say anything by way of grandstanding promises, because words mean nothing. What I will do, or at least what my new goal will be, is actively refrain from writing about anything that I haven’t tried, tested, perfected, and truly come to understand for myself personally. I think that’s probably fair. That way I’m not plagiarizing a principle, but recounting experience.</p>
