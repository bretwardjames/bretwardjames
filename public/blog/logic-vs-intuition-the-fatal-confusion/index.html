	<p><img src="http://static1.squarespace.com/static/5b29b282b27e39d3891a137e/5b29d50ac07b083624e43ad2/5b29d50bc07b083624e43b07/1529468457009/pexels-photo-310386-e1498099319292.jpeg" alt="" /></p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve become more and more aware recently of how often people claim to appeal to logic, when in fact they are appealing to intuition. The sad part is that most of the time, people don&rsquo;t even realize what they&rsquo;re doing. It turns out that about 99% of the time, people unwittingly disguise their own intuition as logic, and by so doing ascribe certain attributes and characteristics to logic that simply do not exist.</p>

<p>What people don&rsquo;t understand (I didn&rsquo;t even understand this until recently) is that there is a big difference between that which is intuitive and that which is logical. Logic is characterized by a rigorous application of certain axioms (e.g. modus ponens, modus tollens, reductio ad absurdum, and so on), constructed in such a way so as to show the truth of certain proposals. In other words, logic involves proofs. Intuition, on the other hand, does not. In fact, intuition consists of those concepts or ideas which make rational sense in a person&rsquo;s mind without any appeal to proof. It would seem, then, that logic only comes after the proof has been constructed, and only intuition can come before that.</p>

<p>What I&rsquo;m trying to say is that you can&rsquo;t just make an appeal to logic without actually considering real logical implications. And most importantly, you can&rsquo;t assume that just because something doesn&rsquo;t make sense to you that it&rsquo;s not logical. In fact, most of the time, real logic is far from intuitive. The reason why we want to equate our intuition with logic is because we understand on some level that logic is objective and intuition is subjective; we could be wrong!</p>

<p>One individual who is particularly guilty of equating logic with intuition is none other than Dr. Gregory House, M.D.. He appeals to logic at least once every episode, and yet there is absolutely no logic involved in any of his arguments. In fact, the closest he ever gets to real logic is when he says, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not logical.&rdquo; The closest that he ever gets to constructing a proof is when he says, &ldquo;That doesn&rsquo;t make any sense.&rdquo; Well yeah moron, it doesn&rsquo;t make sense to you, but that doesn&rsquo;t make it illogical. The aggregate sum of your experiences which has led you to believe so totally in your own infallibility does not actually constitute objective logic. Just because you thought it doesn&rsquo;t make it right, or rather, just because you call it logic doesn&rsquo;t make it logic!</p>

<p>He also makes the absolutely fatal mistake of using the term &ldquo;rational&rdquo; in certain instances when he means to use &ldquo;logical&rdquo; but should use the following sentence: &ldquo;I like/dislike that idea.&rdquo; At least that way he&rsquo;d be speaking honestly.</p>

<p>Another example, which I encountered last week, is the scene from The Lion, The Witch, and the Wardrobe (the new version), in which Susan and Peter are talking with the professor about Lucy&rsquo;s newfound obsession with Narnia. I love how the professor responds. I found a transcription of the scene:</p>

<p>Susan: It&rsquo;s our sister sir, Lucy.</p>

<p>Prof: The weeping girl?</p>

<p>Susan: Yes sir, she&rsquo;s upset.</p>

<p>Prof: Hence the weeping</p>

<p>Peter: We can handle it! (takes Susan&rsquo;s sleeve)</p>

<p>Prof: Oh, I can see that.</p>

<p>Susan: She thinks she&rsquo;s found a magical land in the upstairs wardrobe.</p>

<p>Prof: What did you say!?</p>

<p>Peter: The wardrobe upstairs, Lucy thinks she&rsquo;s found a forest inside.</p>

<p>Prof: What was it like?</p>

<p>Susan: Like talking to a lunatic!</p>

<p>Prof: No, not her - the forest!</p>

<p>Peter: You&hellip;.you actually believe her?</p>

<p>Prof: Well don&rsquo;t you?</p>

<p>Susan: Well, logically it couldn&rsquo;t possibly be there!</p>

<p>Prof: What do they teach at these schools?</p>

<p>Peter: Edmund said they were only pretending</p>

<p>Prof: And he&rsquo;s the more truthful one is he?</p>

<p>Peter: No, this would be the first time.</p>

<p>Prof: Well then, if your sister isn&rsquo;t lying and isn&rsquo;t mad then logically we must assume that she is telling the truth.</p>

<p>This scene shows the perfect juxtaposition of logic and intuition. Susan, as is the case with most people, is so caught up in her own intuition that she fails to see that the only logical option here is that Lucy is telling the truth. The professor points that out very clearly, and incidentally, the professor presents a compelling proof to that effect. Here is the proof:</p>

<ol>
<li>Lucy says that she and Edmund went to Narnia.</li>
<li>Edmund says that they didn&rsquo;t go to Narnia.</li>
<li>Either Lucy or Edmund is lying.</li>
<li>It&rsquo;s more likely that Edmund is lying.</li>
<li>Lucy isn&rsquo;t crazy.</li>
<li>Lucy isn&rsquo;t lying and Lucy isn&rsquo;t crazy.
C. Lucy and Edmund did go to Narnia.</li>
</ol>

<p>That&rsquo;s logic.</p>

<p>Like I said before, logic is rarely intuitive, but because we associate logic with objective truth, and because we all invariably want to believe in our own infallibility, we tend to equate our own intuition with that objective truth in order to avoid the painful process of realizing that there is a possibility that our intuition is simply wrong.</p>

<p>The problems arise when two people disagree based on intuition but they both try to convince the other of the illogicality of their claims. In other words, when two people try to assert that the way someone else thinks is illogical. You simply can&rsquo;t do that. Logic has nothing to do with how someone thinks, because it is completely objective. It doesn&rsquo;t matter how you think or how you were raised, logic is the same for everyone.</p>

<p>I could go on, but I won&rsquo;t. I&rsquo;ll just end with this:</p>

<p>Don&rsquo;t claim that something is illogical if you can&rsquo;t back it up with a logical proof. Don&rsquo;t claim that someone&rsquo;s logic is flawed without showing, formally, the actual flaw in the structure of the argument. Don&rsquo;t try to accuse someone of being illogical just because it&rsquo;s a convenient way to falsely strengthen your argument. If you disagree with someone, just say, &ldquo;I disagree with you about X because Y,&rdquo; and call it a night. Just don&rsquo;t talk about logic like you know anything about it unless you actually do.</p>
