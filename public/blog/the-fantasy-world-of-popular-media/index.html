	<p>Josh Gwynn brought up an interesting question one day while we were serving together in Ukraine, and I’ve thought a lot about it since. I was reminded of it today in Sunday school, so here it is:</p>

<p>Elder Gwynn was a much younger missionary, and so he had been in the States much more recently than I had, and therefore had a better idea of what “popular culture” was like. Because of this, and also because I was nearing the end of my mission, I would sometimes have him tell me the plot to movies that had come out since I had been in Ukraine. He would then give me a 5-minute condensation of the movie, and I would feel more “connected” with America. Looking back, it was pretty ridiculous, but everyone gets a little crazy towards the end. Anyway, there is a point to all of this.</p>

<p>One of the movies that we talked about was the latest remake of Superman. Elder Gwynn told me that he was so disappointed in that movie because Superman is supposed to be the epitome of moral, clean living (at least according to the original embodiment of the character), and the premise of this movie is that he had fornicated with Louis Lane and they had a child together. We talked about that for a while and then an interesting thought came to me that you’ll see turns into the basis of this idea that I’m talking about. I’m going to digress a touch but this will come full circle, I promise.</p>

<p>We, as a media-driven society, have given an enormous amount of power and freedom of creation to the artists that drive the media. Authors, film-makers, even musicians to some extent have the freedom to create whatever they want. The unfortunate consequence of this is that they are allowed to create universes and worlds with morals that they themselves determine and understandings of right and wrong that they themselves dictate. For example, in the Ocean’s 12 trilogy, the antagonists and the protagonists seem to have switched roles. In that universe, it is the thief who is in the right, and the law that is in the wrong. The movies are very entertaining, and the main characters very charming, and so they artfully cover up the fact that the good guys are felons!</p>

<p>In the same way, one of the most popular and what is widely accepted as the best-made series of movies of all time is the Godfather trilogy. Again, this entire movie is about the mafia. We watch these movies and the whole time we want the gangsters to end up winning in the end. And yet because it is such good acting, we never seem to realize that fact. We would never want these people anywhere near our children, and yet we bring them right into our living rooms.</p>

<p>I could go on and on with examples, but I don’t think I need to. What I told Elder Gwynn was that because the writer of that film was even writing about Superman, he was writing God and morality right out of that world with it. Based on that principle, Superman didn’t act immorally because he doesn’t exist in the same reality as morals and God do.</p>

<p>That’s the danger of the media, and that is where the “fantasy” comes into play. So often when we think of the word fantasy we think of fantasizing, or making up fantastic (fairy tale) stories in our heads. The reality is that all of these fake existences that movies and books can invent create a fantasy universe that so many people try to accept as reality. There are countless movies where the husband or wife is applauded in the end for leaving his/her spouse in the name of “true love” with someone else. And at the end of the movie, we’re happy for them because they’re finally with the one they truly love. That might be ok in the fictional place where those characters exist, but it is not ok in this one. Being a criminal might be ok and even glamorous in the above mentioned movies, but it is not ok in reality.</p>

<p>The caution is this: Be very careful not only what you believe from the movies, but what you watch at all. The movie or book might have a great message, but if it gets you one little step closer to actually believing all of the crap that was thrown in there just to get that “good message” across, then you’ve already lost a chunk of your touch with reality. Almost every movie these days has a scene in it with some form of fornication or adultery. Every time you watch that, your mind accepts that situation a little more. Don’t risk it. The only way to keep in touch with real reality is to stay away from fake reality.</p>

<p>Let your moral standards be fixed and immovable. If you believe in marital fidelity (this includes premarital abstinence), don’t watch movies that even suggest infidelity. If you do, sooner or later you will no longer believe in marital fidelity. If you believe in being an upstanding citizen of your country, do not watch movies that suggest criminal behavior to be moral. If you do, sooner or later you will lose your belief in citizenship. If you believe in God, be very, very careful about watching movies that suggest that He does not exist, or sooner or later you will lose that belief as well.</p>

<p>Do not get stuck in fantasy worlds. Remember to separate fiction from reality, and let real reality be your reality.</p>
