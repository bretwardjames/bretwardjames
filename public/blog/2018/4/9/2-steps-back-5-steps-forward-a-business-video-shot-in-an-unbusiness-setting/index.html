	<p>This is a video about BUSINESS, shot in an extremely UNBUSINESS setting. Sometimes the best way forward is actually to turn around and reset.</p>

<p>Sometimes I have my best thoughts when I&rsquo;m working out. And this is how I work out.</p>

<p>I was walking my dog one day and these two ladies stopped me and asked which way to Balboa Park.</p>

<p>I turned around and pointed the way I&rsquo;d just been coming, and said it&rsquo;s directly that way. So you&rsquo;ll want to:  1. Head up this street until it ends  2. Then follow it to the left  3. Then right when that street is about to turn left again, you&rsquo;ll take a little side path down to the next street  4. Turn left  5. Follow that all the way up.</p>

<p>They both looked at me a bit confused, and were like I thought it was easier to get there than that. Then it hit me, if they just turned around, it was two right turns and they were there.</p>

<p>So I turned them around, said turn right at the next intersection, walk 3 blocks to Sixth, turn right, and then follow that all the way to the park.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s a map so you can get an idea:</p>

<pre><code>  ![](http://static1.squarespace.com/static/5b29b282b27e39d3891a137e/5b29d50ac07b083624e43ad2/5b2a85c32b6a28f608c0a086/1529513432682/Screen+Shot+2018-04-09+at+7.48.58+AM.png.58+AM.png?format=original)
</code></pre>

<p>The point, of course, is sometimes you can&rsquo;t get so caught up in the direction you&rsquo;re going that you don&rsquo;t see an easier and better way of getting where you want to go. Sometimes turning around is faster than trying to muscle through.</p>
