	<p>Public Service Announcement Regarding Sugar</p>

<p>We take a slight break from our usual Morning Coffee show for a PSA about sugar :)</p>

<p>In the span of my life, science has changed its mind about sugar about 12 times.</p>

<p>Then, more recently, it became common knowledge that some of the early “science” was influenced heavily by parts of the food industry that were heavy on added sugar in their foods.</p>

<p>I haven’t done my homework on reading the studies or the research, but here’s what I know:</p>

<p>I’ve paid a LOT more attention to my health, diet, physique, and energy over the last 5 years or so. I’ve kind of had to.</p>

<p>In that time, I’ve noticed a couple of things about sugar that have been true (for me) every time.</p>

<p>Sugar in any form is HELPFUL for fueling and recovering from an intense workout (emphasis on intense)</p>

<p>When not paired with intense exercise, sugar consumption causes me to sleep more hours (but feel less rested)</p>

<p>Every time I’ve made an effort to restrict my sugar consumption, I’ve lost on average 10 pounds within 3 weeks.</p>

<p>Everything else tastes better when I’m restricting my sugar consumption.</p>

<p>The big caveat here is this:</p>

<p>Restricting sugar consumption is HARD. Everything has added sugar. Like, EVERYTHING.</p>

<p>I’m not even going to take this any further. At this point I feel like you can come to your own conclusions about that.</p>

<p>PSA over :)</p>
