	<p>The number one obstacle to forward motion in any endeavor is friction.</p>

<p>We expend a lot of energy to overcome the friction in our lives, but we tend not to do much to remove the friction altogether.</p>

<p>We set goals, we develop discipline, we push and push and overcome, but think how much further we&rsquo;d go, given that same amount of energy, if the friction was reduced by half?</p>

<p>I have experienced this in so many different ways and across so many years that it&rsquo;s become extremely clear to me:</p>

<p>Friction is like putting a governor on your car. It&rsquo;s an actual limitation. It may not limit the destination itself, but it can make it MUCH more difficult and time consuming to get there.</p>

<p>I think most of us can point to the major sources of friction in our lives. Negative people, overbearing bosses, government regulations, etc. And there are plenty of people talking about how to handle that friction. Get rid of negative people, quit your job, find somewhere else if your government won&rsquo;t allow you to do your thing.</p>

<p>But the friction that is the most damaging in the long term is the friction that is more subtle. It&rsquo;s less obvious, less dramatic.</p>

<p>For example:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Do you BELIEVE you can do what you&rsquo;re trying to do?</p></li>

<li><p>How do you FEEL about your ability to perform?</p></li>

<li><p>Are you providing yourself with the resources you need to feel positive and believe in yourself?</p></li>

<li><p>Do you KNOW where the friction is coming from?</p></li>

<li><p>Are your actions yours (or are you living out someone else&rsquo;s ideal)?</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Take it from me, these &ldquo;hidden&rdquo; sources of friction slow you down way more over the long term than the more &ldquo;dramatic&rdquo; sources.</p>

<p>Ask yourself those questions and seriously answer them. It might seem &ldquo;woo-woo&rdquo; or &ldquo;hippy-dippy&rdquo;, but I promise if you find those hidden sources of friction and get rid of them, you&rsquo;ll notice the difference.</p>
