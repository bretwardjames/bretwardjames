<p>There is an interesting correlation (for me, anyway) between fighting and my overall health. It makes perfect sense - there&rsquo;s &ldquo;in shape&rdquo; and then there&rsquo;s &ldquo;in <em>fight</em> shape&rdquo;. Preparing for a fight means getting ready for as many different possibilities as you can, and most importantly being ready to last longer than the other guy.</p>

<p>I know that using weight as an indicator for health is generally inaccurate, but in my case it&rsquo;s the best indication. When I&rsquo;m in shape and in good health, I&rsquo;m within 7 pounds of 180. When I&rsquo;m out of shape, eating crap all the time, stressed, and unhappy&hellip;let&rsquo;s just say I&rsquo;m well outside that range.</p>

<p>Enter Exhibit A:</p>

<pre><code>   [caption id=&quot;&quot; align=&quot;alignnone&quot; width=&quot;1904.0&quot;]![ Exhibit A - Visual Representation of My Weight Over Time ](http://static1.squarespace.com/static/5b29b282b27e39d3891a137e/5b29d50ac07b083624e43ad2/5b3a43f4aa4a993b0dd679ba/1530545153142/weightchart3.png)

<p>Exhibit A - Visual Representation of My Weight Over Time [/caption]</p>

<p>So let&rsquo;s break down what we&rsquo;re looking at here:</p>

<h3 id="when-life-started">When Life Started</h3>

<p><img src="http://static1.squarespace.com/static/5b29b282b27e39d3891a137e/5b29d50ac07b083624e43ad2/5b3a5a2c70a6ad54c2338189/1530550830928/IMG_20140531_193307.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p><img src="http://static1.squarespace.com/static/5b29b282b27e39d3891a137e/5b29d50ac07b083624e43ad2/5b3a5b6c03ce6489108837f5/1530551149383/2014-10-30+10.16.16%282%29.jpg.16%282%29.jpg?format=original" alt="" /></p>

<p>All the way on the left there, you can see my first real weigh-in using this particular app. I was 215 pounds, and this is after training for an riding in a full Century (100-mile bike ride), which I took quite seriously and trained for over the course of several months. Needless to say, before that I was hovering around 235-240.</p>

<p>Not a great time for my health. Physical <em>and</em> mental. Talk about body-image issues. I won&rsquo;t even get into the complex that you get as a MAN, knowing you have serious depressions because of the way you look and feeling like you shouldn&rsquo;t but you do anyway. That&rsquo;s a book in itself.</p>

<p><em>Then I started Muay Thai.</em></p>

<p>Almost immediately, I started experience what I call &ldquo;Positive Weight Redistribution&rdquo;. I didn&rsquo;t lose a ton of weight immediately, but I did start to notice my belly, thighs, and face shriveling a bit, and my arms started to develop a bit of tone.</p>

<p>I say <em>didn&rsquo;t lose a ton of weight immediately</em>, but it was around 20 pounds over 3-4 months. Which for me was significant, especially because I wasn&rsquo;t just losing fat and gaining muscle, I was learning a new skill and gaining confidence. I felt like a million bucks!</p>

<h3 id="when-it-became-a-little-more-serious">When It Became A Little More Serious</h3>

<p>About a year after I started training, something shifted and I started to take it a little more seriously. I think part of it was that I&rsquo;d made it through the obligatory year of &ldquo;is this guy going to wash out or stick around&rdquo; and so my trainers and training partners started to consider me one of the team. I was a regular, and people were used to be being a part of the training schedule and everything.</p>

<p><img src="http://static1.squarespace.com/static/5b29b282b27e39d3891a137e/5b29d50ac07b083624e43ad2/5b3a5ff82b6a282dadb89c2a/1530552322709/IMG_0394.JPG" alt="" /></p>

<p><img src="http://static1.squarespace.com/static/5b29b282b27e39d3891a137e/5b29d50ac07b083624e43ad2/5b3a6087f950b796a6ff4c33/1530552457485/temp.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p><img src="http://static1.squarespace.com/static/5b29b282b27e39d3891a137e/5b29d50ac07b083624e43ad2/5b3a5ff870a6ad54c234b034/1530552321187/IMG_0442.JPG" alt="" /></p>

<p>Around that time is when Muay Thai sort of became the most important part of my life. I was no longer passively participating as a hobby - I was living to train. All of my friends were training, and everything revolved around preparing for, and then recovering from, each training session.</p>

<p>I like to believe that my body was responding to my mind becoming more committed to Muay Thai, and decided it was time to shed more of that last layer of padding that it had been carrying around, just in case.</p>

<p>I also noticed around that time that my resting heart rate dropped significantly, and for the first time in a very long time, <em>I was actually happy</em>.</p>

<h3 id="fight-camps">Fight Camps</h3>

<p>I believe the fight camp is the best combination of perfect training conditions. Not only do fighters tend to have a base fitness level that is usually much higher than the average person, but there are a few bonus variables that make it absolutely ideal:  1. Fighting requires power, explosive movement, <em>and</em> extreme cardiovascular endurance  2. The fighter that can create explosive movement, even at the point of complete physical exhaustion, has a better chance of winning  3. The neurological and psychological stress of fighting has a similar effect to fighting at extreme altitude  4. *Bonus variable - you are fighting another person who is not only preparing for the above, but more importantly to be <em>more prepared than you</em> for the above  5. *Bonus variable 2 - your opponent knows that you know that they are trying to out-prepare you</p>

<p>All of these point to one very important fact about fight camps: you have to physically prepare for the worst possible scenario - that your opponent has limitless cardio and will <em>never</em> get tired.</p>

<p>It calls for an intensely grueling training process. There&rsquo;s a reason why even fighters at the very top of the game will push themselves to the point of passing out, throwing up, and collapsing in preparation for a fight. Because they know that their opponent is doing the same, and a sure-fire way to lose the fight is to show up under-prepared.</p>

<p>On the flip side, however, you can overcome a massive size disadvantage by coming in well prepared and well conditioned. This fight video is a classic example of a smaller guy (me) with better conditioning having a much easier time dealing with a much bigger guy (at the time of this fight I&rsquo;m sure he had 15-20 pounds on me).</p>

<h3 id="the-gray-time">The Gray Time</h3>

<p>As if trying to live up to my philosophy degree, my mind created a situation whereby I was able to prove how important fighting and training is to my health by showing what happens when I stop training for an extended period of time.</p>

<p>You&rsquo;ll notice a large section of that first image that I&rsquo;ve aptly named &ldquo;The Gray Time&rdquo;. I&rsquo;m not going to go too far into that story, but I will say that that period of time saw me somewhat compelled to limit my training to once (maybe twice) per week. And you can see very clearly what the result was. Over 15 pounds gained, and I was fast approaching the depression that I hadn&rsquo;t encountered since before I even started training.</p>

<p>Luckily, I recognized what was happening, and even more fortunately, I live with a woman that has been nothing but supportive of me and what&rsquo;s important to me. So I made a change, and now I&rsquo;m back, in better shape and more on fire than before.</p>

<p>In the 4 months since I made that change, I&rsquo;ve been in 3 consecutive fight camps, won 2 fights, and lost over 20 pounds (again). I feel amazing, my clothes are too big again, and I am on top of the world.</p>

<p>Conclusion: fighting is good for my health. And <em>not</em> training is bad for my health.</p>

<p>Ergo: I train, I fight.</p>
