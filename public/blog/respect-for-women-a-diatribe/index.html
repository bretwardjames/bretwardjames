	<p>Recent events have gotten me thinking about a lot of the things that I think are seriously wrong with modern society, and I want to start listing them. There are a couple of people that will think that I wrote this aimed directly at them, but never fear, this has been on my mind for a lot longer than just today. This diatribe is directed at all people, everywhere.</p>

<p>I’ve come to the conclusion that our society has completely lost its sense of respect in general, but most blatantly (and most disgustingly), its respect for women. I cannot believe the kinds of things that are permitted and sometimes encouraged to be said to women these days. It’s simply revolting. And the worst part is, the demeaning things that people say tend to pale in comparison to the ridiculously demeaning things that society has done to women in the past 50 years. Let me just go on a little rant about it.</p>

<p>Women have been turned into objects. It is so blatantly obvious what society thinks of women and what they are ‘good for’. Women are seen primarily as objects of sexual gratification, tools for men and even other women to achieve some sort of release. Men don’t ever talk about women in terms of their truly important characteristics, like grace, character, integrity, or fidelity. Instead all we ever hear is talk of their purely physical, purely temporary attributes, such as hotness, sexiness, breast size, shape of their buttocks, and worst of all, their potential to be a good sexual partner! What the crap is wrong with us?! Women are more than their bodies! Women are people. Human beings. In many cases, women are more human than men are, and yet the media with all its unchecked influence has portrayed women as having the sole function of pleasing men sexually and culinarily (but mostly sexually). As such, men (and women) have come to believe that they are in fact dominant, and women are meant only for their pleasure. Teenage boyfriends are expecting sex after 4 or 5 dates, and among adults the third date is almost always when the sexuality rounds third base and heads for home. The worst part is that when those women refuse to ‘put out’, they are demeaned even more and treated as though they are in the wrong! What the crap is that?! Women are not meant to be the playthings of the over-excited.</p>

<p>At the other end of the spectrum, to add insult to injury, are the places where hard-working women have to fend off inferences and struggle for their dignity. Women in the workplace are treated like garbage, and for that reason alone, women in the workplace are some of the most hardened people out there. They have to be, because there is no other way for them to survive. It is a hard-wired fact in our country that it is an embarrassment for a man to be out-done by a woman at anything, and so men have to preemptively strike to avoid the possibility of embarrassment. And the worst thing is when a man is shown up by a woman anyway. Suddenly he must save face. Suddenly the woman is an enemy.</p>

<p>I see it every day, all around me. The students I interact with all the time all share these same tendencies. Women are simply seen as less than men, and it’s ridiculous. </p>

<p>Bottom line: What happened to the days when everyone stood up when a woman walked in a room? I’m not saying we should go back to the old fashioned way of doing things, but holding doors and being polite are just common courtesies that I thought were taught back in kindergarten. Our modern society needs to get a grip on itself and show some respect to women. It needs more men that are willing to stand up for women and fight their cause. It needs more women to stand up and realize their true worth and live accordingly. And the absolute bottom line is this:</p>

<p>If I ever see anyone disrespect a woman in public for any reason whatsoever, I will get involved.</p>
