<meta itemprop="description" content="I never liked the idea of &ldquo;paying my dues&rdquo;. I always thought that was beneath me for some reason.
I just wanted people to notice what I was doing and give me the credit that I thought I deserved.
Ironically enough, although I was (and still am) KILLING it in the work I was doing, I hadn&rsquo;t done ANYTHING to deserve the notoriety or credit I was after.
Sure, I have always gotten a lot of referrals for business because I do good work, but what I really WANTED was for someone to ask me to speak from stage, or come out and present to 50 staff members, or co-present on a webinar to a couple thousand people.">

	<p>I never liked the idea of &ldquo;paying my dues&rdquo;. I always thought that was beneath me for some reason.</p>

<p>I just wanted people to notice what I was doing and give me the credit that I thought I deserved.</p>

<p>Ironically enough, although I was (and still am) KILLING it in the work I was doing, I hadn&rsquo;t done ANYTHING to deserve the notoriety or credit I was after.</p>

<p>Sure, I have always gotten a lot of referrals for business because I do good work, but what I really WANTED was for someone to ask me to speak from stage, or come out and present to 50 staff members, or co-present on a webinar to a couple thousand people.</p>

<p>I wasn&rsquo;t willing (until recently) to acknowledge that the way you get to stage and to cohost and guest blog and all that is by creating a brand, not just by doing good work.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s not that good work isn&rsquo;t important. It&rsquo;s fundamentally important, and it&rsquo;s the backbone of the whole thing, but it&rsquo;s not going to get you the recognition you&rsquo;re looking for all on its own.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s like a car engine. You can have the most powerful car engine, but without gas, it&rsquo;s not going anywhere.</p>

<p>By the same token, all the gas in the world isn&rsquo;t going to get you very far if your engine is no good.</p>

<p>So, just like I&rsquo;d spent a decade patiently and arduously developing my skills on the technology and consulting side, I had to decide to make a decision to make that same journey for my brand.</p>

<p>I have to pay my dues just like everyone else in order to get what I want.</p>

<p>It takes a bit of humility to realize that you have to start back at square one, but I get super excited about it.</p>

<p>The Dues of Entrepreneurship are time, energy, and effort.</p>

<p>You can&rsquo;t get around paying them.</p>
